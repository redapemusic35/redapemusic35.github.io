# What is Law?

Jurisprudence is a theory about the ontological nature of law.

* How do we answer this question?
  * Definition?
  * Description of the word law?
* Is it a set of practices?
  * Which ones count as law?
  * Who decides?
  * Who's practices count?

## HLA Hart (1907-1992)

### The Concept of Law (1961)

Jurisprudence seeks to explain the central features of legal practice.

> It does this by exploring the relationship of law to other social practices to which it is related and with which it might be confused.

* Law uses rules to regulate or govern human conduct.

However, morality also uses rules to regulate or govern human conduct.
