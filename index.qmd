:::{style="text-align: center"}

This course will explore enduring questions regarding beauty and, itâ€™s place in art, philosophy and lifeÍ¾ we will consider what an encounter with beauty is, we will consider the transformative power of beauty and art. We will ask about the relationships between art, art criticism, excellence in art and the human experience of beauty. We will consider how all of this works in modernity: a world of mass production, museums, commercial appropriation of art, and ubiquitous reproductions of works of art.
