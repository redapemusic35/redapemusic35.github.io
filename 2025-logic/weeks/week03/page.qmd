🎥 I have received some requests to record the lectures. This week I will attempt to do just that.

## Formalization

🚧 Here we will be looking at scope. We use ***syntax*** in logic to determine what a logical operator covers 🚧


## 📚 Formation Rules

- In this section, we replace propositions 'Aristotle is orange', with sentence letters 'P', and logical operators 'if then', 'or', 'therefore', etc., with symbols. Check the end of slides for the list of references cited in the lecture.
