# Classical Propositional Logic

## Valuation Rules

## What's the point in all of this?

Consider the following proposition:

# P $\rightarrow$ (Q & (R $\lor$ S)) {.center .middle}

If Jim stole the cookie, then Jim is guilty and either he deserves life in prison or he deserves death.

## We have

A number of formulas that together form the proposition below. (Formula is a fancy way of saying 'claim')

Claim / Formula: P $\rightarrow$ (Q & (R $\lor$ S))

## This claim / formula is made up of the following claims / formulas:

* The claim that: 'Jim stole the cookie'; 'P'

* The claim that: 'Jim is guilty'; 'Q'

* The claim that: 'Jim deserves life in prison'; 'R'

* The claim that: 'Jim deserves death'; 'S'

## Any one of these can be true,

Or . . . they can all be true. What we ultimately want to know, is whether together, they make a true proposition, that if:

* Jim stole the cookie,

Then

* Jim is guilty,

and

## He either

* deserves life in prison,

# Or He Deserves Death {.center .middle}

<div style="width:360px;max-width:100%;"><div style="height:0;padding-bottom:56.11%;position:relative;"><iframe width="360" height="202" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameBorder="0" src="https://imgflip.com/embed/a6yfpe"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://imgflip.com/gif/a6yfpe">via Imgflip</a></p></div>

## But there are many other claims as well . . .

* If Jim stole the cookie, then he is guilty.

This claim is an independent one.

* Jim is guilty and deserves either life in prison, or death

* He deserves life in prison or he deserves death

These are all independent claims

---

What we want to know, is whether any of them acts as a logical contradiction, or fail in some other way when combined with the others. Consider the two claims below:

* 'The boy is tall'

* 'The boy is not tall'

# Some possible formulas

Together we have:

* 'The boy is tall and the boy is not tall'

A contradiction

Or

* 'The boy is tall or the boy is not tall'

Not a contradiction

# Lets do some more

* 'If the boy is tall, then the boy is not tall'

* 'The boy is tall if and only if he is not tall'

* 'It is not the case that the boy is tall' ('The boy is not tall')

## 4 Semantic properties we can test for

![Semantic Properties](./../../../figures/logic/4-semantic-properties.png)

---

1. Valid sequent, whether there is some valuation/situation in which the premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

2. Determine whether a formula is consistent or inconsistent. Whether it entails a logical contradiction

3. Determine whether a formula is valid: A formula is valid if it is true under every possible interpretation (assignment) of truth values.

4. Determine whether a formula is contingent: whether a formula is consistent (2), but not valid (3)

# This does not apply here. Here is why . . .

## This is an argument

## Jim is guilty and deserves life in prison or death

If Jim stole the cookie, then Jim is guilty and either he deserves life in prison or he deserves death.

Jim did steal the cookie.

Therefore, Jim is guilty and either he deserves life in prison or he deserves death.

---

P $\rightarrow$ (Q & (R $\lor$ S))

P

Therefore,

(Q & (R $\lor$ S))

## However, we are only looking at a formula, a single claim. Not an argument.

* An argument has a premise

* And an argument has a conclusion

* Ours is a single claim

# Second test

2. Determine whether a formula (not an argument/sequent), is consistent.

---

***Brief Foray into Consistency . . .***

![](./../../../figures/logic/consistency.png)

* In everyday language, consistency means reliable.
  * An athlete who is consistent, is one who performs consistently well.
  * An inconsistent athlete is one who performs well sometimes.

* In logic, a formula is consistent if it is logically possible for it to be true under all its formulations.
  * It does not entail a logical contradiction.
  * 'The boy is tall' and 'the boy is short' would entail a logical contradiction. (T & ~T)

# In other words

Since we have a formula only, not an argument, we want to know three things.

1. Is it consistent?

2. Is it valid?

3. Is it contingent?

# Consistency

Construct a truth tree starting with the formula. If all the paths close, then the formula is inconsistent.

![Inconsistent Formula](./../../../figures/logic/consistency.png)

## Is it possible for . . .

* The claim that: 'Jim stole the cookie'; 'P'

* The claim that: 'Jim is guilty'; 'Q'

* The claim that: 'Jim deserves life in prison'; 'R'

* The claim that: 'Jim deserves death'; 'S'

To all be true at the same time?

# This depends on the logical operators . . .

* If Jim stole the cookie(?)

* Then is he guilty?

* And . . .(?)

---

## Will our paths close like this?

![](./../../../figures/logic/closed-paths.png)

# First we start with the formula

![](./../../../figures/logic/jim-claim.png)

## Then look at the main operator . . .

P $\rightarrow$ (Q & (R $\lor$ S))

# What does the valuation rule for '$\rightarrow$' say?

![](./../../../figures/logic/v-for-arrow.png)

## This is what we are paying attention to . . .

![](./../../../figures/logic/v-rules-important.png)

## In other words . . .

![](./../../../figures/logic/v-arrow-picture.png)

# So step 1 . . .

![](./../../../figures/logic/using-v-rule-arrow.png)

# Step 2 . . .

![](./../../../figures/logic/using-conj-v.png)

# See all the open paths?

![](./../../../figures/logic/open-paths.png)

## This means that

| ~ P | Q | R | S |
|--|--|--|--|
| T | T | T | T |

or

| P | Q | R | S |
|--|--|--|--|
| F | T | T | T |

# Or . . .

| ~P | $\rightarrow$ | ( | Q | & | ( R | $\lor$ | S ) | ) |
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
| F | T | | | T | | T | | |

Therefore, the claim:

* If Jim stole the cookie then he is guilty and deserves life in prison or death

# Is true if:

* it is true that because Jim stole the cookie

* that he deserves either

  * life in prison

## Or

# Death
