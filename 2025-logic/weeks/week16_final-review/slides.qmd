# Final Review

## Chapter 3

### Semantic Trees 

> A Semantic tree is a device for displaying all the valuations on which a formula or set of formulas is true. [Nolt's, 65]

---

Helpful to read Chapter 10 of "IFL2".

> We have designed PL languages so that the syntactic structure of a wff, i.e. the way that the symbols are put together into grammatical strings, is a perfect guide to its semantic structure, and in particular to the way the
truth value of the whole will depend on the truth values of the atoms.

---

Trees then depend on the concept that for a formula to be true, its parts are also true. As such, every branch that is written into a truth tree, is true.
