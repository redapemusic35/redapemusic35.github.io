## Informal Inferences
Which of the following arguments are valid? Where an argument is valid, sketch an informal proof.

1. Only medical school graduates are good doctors. No existentialists are medical school graduates. Some existentialists are
French doctors. So, some French doctors are not good doctors.

2. Everything that happens is determined by a prior event. No action should be punished if the agent isn’t responsible
for it. Agents are only responsible for actions they can avoid doing. Hence no action should be
punished.
