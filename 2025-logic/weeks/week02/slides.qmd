## Sentences {.smaller}

* There are many types of sentences, e.g., imperatives

![Commandments](https://i0.wp.com/stillromancatholicafteralltheseyears.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MOSES-TEN-COMMANDMENTS.jpg?ssl=1)

## We will focus on declarative sentences

## Is a commandment true or false? {.center}

## The Most Famous Reindeer of All

1. If the fetus is a person, then abortion is murder.

2. The fetus is a person.

$\therefore$

3. Abortion is murder.

---

### Sentence Letters {.center}

**P**

**Q**

Sometimes **S**, or even **R**.

## Remember?

Replace the claims with sentence letters and ignore the connectives for now.

* Look only for true or false statements.

1. If the fetus is a person, then abortion is murder.

2. The fetus is a person.

$\therefore$

3. Abortion is murder.

---

For now, lets leave the connetives there, but replace the propositions with sentence letters.

1. If, P, then Q.

2. P.

$\therefore$

3. Q.

---

1. IF it is not true that all swans are white,

2. AND the president believes that all swans are white,

3. THEN the president is fallible

---

1. IF it is not true that all swans are white,

2. AND the president believes that all swans are white,

3. THEN the president is fallible

---

1. If, **P** *and* **Q**

2. then, **R**

---

1. If Clara won't get the raise, then she'll quit.

2. She won't get the raise.

$\therefore$

3. She'll quit.

---

1. If she quits, Clara won't get the raise.

2. She won't get the raise.

$\therefore$

3. She'll quit.

## Valid and Falacious Argument Forms

* Modus Ponens

* Affirming the Consequent

## Let's identify the main components of this argument

>  In Bernard Suits‚Äô The Grasshopper and Return of the Grasshopper, game-play is
claimed to be the ‚Äòideal of existence‚Äô and the only activity that could sustain us
through the ‚Äòendless and endlessly boring summer‚Äô of utopia. Christopher
Yorke has challenged these claims by way of a constructive dilemma. If these
games are sufficiently akin to the games we play, then they are not adequate to
the task of rendering immortality tolerable. If these games are importantly
different than the games we play, then, in being ‚Äòunknown and unknowable‚Äô,
they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own
and, so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration.
Against Yorke‚Äôs skepticism, I argue that the games that constitute the ideal of
existence are intelligible to us because we already play what the Grasshopper
calls ‚Äòopen games‚Äô. Steffen Borge concedes that utopian games are intelligible,
but argues that such games would fail to ‚Äògrab our minds and imagination‚Äô. In
the second half of the paper, I contend, against Borge, that such open games
are adequate to the task of sustaining the interest of an immortal community.

* In Bernard Suits‚Äô The Grasshopper and Return of the Grasshopper, game-play is
claimed to be the ‚Äòideal of existence‚Äô and the only activity that could sustain us

* How many propositions can you identify?

* How many true or false statements?

But let's imagine, for instance, that one part is true and the other false.

* In Bernard Suits‚Äô *The Grasshopper* and *Return of the Grasshopper*,

1. game-play is claimed to be the ‚Äòideal of existence‚Äô

and

2. the only activity that could sustain us through the ‚Äòendless and endlessly boring summer‚Äô of utopia.

Perhaps a brief aside on the use of scope in logical operators. What does the attributions of true or false cover?

Another aside, and something we will return to, so remember this, but let's imagine that 1) is true, but 2) is false.

Here, we have more conditional statements.

* If these games are sufficiently akin to the games we play, then they are not adequate to the task of rendering immortality tolerable.

* If, . . . then

* $\rightarrow$

1. Antecedent: These games are sufficiently akin to the games we play.

2. Consequent: They are not adequate to the task of rendering immortality tolerable.

3. These games are sufficiently akin to the games we play. $\rightarrow$ They are not adequate to the task of rendering immortality tolerable.

::: {.notes}

They cannot aliviate us of our boredom.

Why are they inadequate for alliviating our boredom?

The consequent then, becomes the conclusion of another argument. What is the argument?

## But this looks weird and not helpful.

3. P $\rightarrow$ Q

Just like above, we replace the propositions with sentence letters.

Look at this second conditional. First, let's split it into its antecendent and consequent parts.

* Christopher Yorke has challenged these claims by way of a constructive dilemma.

* Either, or

::: {.notes}

What is a constructive dilemma?

* What is a dilemma?

:::

## First,

* P = These games are like the ones we play.

* Q = These games make immortality tolerable.

* R = Characterize a form of life that is different from our own.

## Either What?

1. P $\rightarrow$ $\neg$ Q

2. $\neg$ P $\rightarrow$ ($\neg$ P $\rightarrow$ $\neg$ R)

## Your standard ***Modus Ponens***

The long way,

2. $\neg$ P $\rightarrow$ ($\neg$ P $\rightarrow$ $\neg$ R)

Because we want to simplify premise 2,

## Consider the sequent:

> To save space, we often write an entire form on one line. [p. 23]

3. $\neg$ P $\rightarrow$ $\neg$ R

4. $\neg$ P

$\therefore$ $\neg$ R

Becomes,

* $\neg$ P $\rightarrow$ $\neg$ R, $\neg$ P $\vdash$ $\neg$ R

There is something important regarding 'and so' here. Before when we've seen *and*, we said that was a logical operator connecting two propositions. But 'so' seems to change the use of *and* here. What do you think?

## The Ontological Argument

Let's identify the main components of this argument.

> So, then, no one who understands what God is can conceive that God does not exist; although he says these words in his heart, either without any, or with some, foreign signification. For; God is that than which a greater cannot be conceived. And he who thoroughly understands this assuredly understands that this being so truly exists, that not even in concept can it be nonexistent. Therefore, he who understands that God so exists cannot conceive that he does not exist.

## Formation Rules

We are going to be looking for:

* ***Propositions*** (Sentences/tf Statements)

* ***Logical Operators*** (Connect Propositions)

* ***Scope*** (Which logical operators apply to which propositions)

::: {.notes}

> The formulas of propositional logic have a grammar, and that grammar (or syntax) may be
precisely articulated as formation rules. Formation rules define what counts as a formula by giving
general directions for assembling formulas out of simple symbols, or characters. They are the rules
of grammar for a formal language. In order to state the formation rules for propositional logic, we
need first to define the character set for propositional logic‚Äîthat is, the alphabet and punctuation
marks from which the formulas of its language are constructed. We stipulate that a character for the
language of propositional logic is anything belonging to one of the following four sets:

::: {.notes}

> Anything that is not a formula by finitely many applications of these rules is not a formula.
Notice that in stating the formation rules, we use Greek letters (which belong to the metalanguage
(see Section 1.5), not to the language of propositional logic). They are variables that stand for
formulas of propositional logic. The Greek indicates generality. For example, ÔÅÜ and ÔÅô in rule 3 stand
for any formulas, no matter how simple or complex. When they are combined with operators and
brackets into a complex expression, this expression stands for any formula obtainable by replacing
the Greek letters with formulas. Thus, for example, the expression '(ÔÅÜ & ÔÅô)' stands for '(P & Q)',
'(ÔÅæR & S)', '((P ÔÉö R) & (Q ÔÇÆ ÔÅæÔÅæS))', etc. Use of English letters here would be inappropriate, since they
would too easily be confused with individual expressions of the object language.7 In contrast to such
expressions as '(P & Q)', expressions containing Greek letters, such as '(ÔÅÜ & ÔÅô)', are not formulas.
Rather, they are metalinguistic devices used for referring to whole classes of formulas.
Repeated (recursive) application of the formation rules enables us to construct a great variety
of formulas. So, for example, 'P' and 'Q' are formulas by rule 1. Hence by rule 3, '(P ÔÉö Q)' is a
formula. Now by rule 1 again 'R' is a formula, from which it follows by rule 2 that 'ÔÅæR' is a formula and
again by rule 2 that 'ÔÅæÔÅæR' is a formula. Hence, since both '(P ÔÉö Q)' and 'ÔÅæÔÅæR' are formulas, by rule 3
'((P ÔÉö Q) ÔÇÆ ÔÅæÔÅæR)' is a formula. And since this is a formula, by rule 2 again, 'ÔÅæ((P ÔÉö Q) ÔÇÆ ÔÅæÔÅæR)' is also
a formula. And so on! In this way we can build up formulas as complex as we like.
Notice that the only formation rule that introduces brackets is rule 3. This means that the only
legitimate function of a pair of brackets is to delineate the scope of some binary operator. In
particular, brackets are not used to indicate the scopes of either sentence letters or the negation
operator. Thus, for example, none of the following expressions count as formulas: [p. 29]
