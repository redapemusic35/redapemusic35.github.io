## Sentences {.smaller}

* There are many types of sentences, e.g., imperatives

![Commandments](https://i0.wp.com/stillromancatholicafteralltheseyears.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MOSES-TEN-COMMANDMENTS.jpg?ssl=1)

## We will focus on declarative sentences

## Is a commandment true or false? {.center}

## The Most Famous Reindeer of All

1. If the fetus is a person, then abortion is murder.

2. The fetus is a person.

$\therefore$

3. Abortion is murder.

---

### Sentence Letters {.center}

**P**

**Q**

Sometimes **S**, or even **R**.

## Remember?

Replace the claims with sentence letters and ignore the connectives for now.

* Look only for true or false statements.

1. If the fetus is a person, then abortion is murder.

2. The fetus is a person.

$\therefore$

3. Abortion is murder.

---

For now, lets leave the connetives there, but replace the propositions with sentence letters.

1. If, P, then Q.

2. P.

$\therefore$

3. Q.

---

1. IF it is not true that all swans are white,

2. AND the president believes that all swans are white,

3. THEN the president is fallible

---

1. IF it is not true that all swans are white,

2. AND the president believes that all swans are white,

3. THEN the president is fallible

---

1. If, **P** *and* **Q**

2. then, **R**

---

1. If Clara won't get the raise, then she'll quit.

2. She won't get the raise.

$\therefore$

3. She'll quit.

---

1. If she quits, Clara won't get the raise.

2. She won't get the raise.

$\therefore$

3. She'll quit.

## Valid and Falacious Argument Forms

* Modus Ponens

* Affirming the Consequent

## Let's identify the main components of this argument

>  In Bernard Suits‚Äô The Grasshopper and Return of the Grasshopper, game-play is
claimed to be the ‚Äòideal of existence‚Äô and the only activity that could sustain us
through the ‚Äòendless and endlessly boring summer‚Äô of utopia. Christopher
Yorke has challenged these claims by way of a constructive dilemma. If these
games are sufficiently akin to the games we play, then they are not adequate to
the task of rendering immortality tolerable. If these games are importantly
different than the games we play, then, in being ‚Äòunknown and unknowable‚Äô,
they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own
and, so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration.
Against Yorke‚Äôs skepticism, I argue that the games that constitute the ideal of
existence are intelligible to us because we already play what the Grasshopper
calls ‚Äòopen games‚Äô. Steffen Borge concedes that utopian games are intelligible,
but argues that such games would fail to ‚Äògrab our minds and imagination‚Äô. In
the second half of the paper, I contend, against Borge, that such open games
are adequate to the task of sustaining the interest of an immortal community.

* In Bernard Suits‚Äô The Grasshopper and Return of the Grasshopper, game-play is
claimed to be the ‚Äòideal of existence‚Äô and the only activity that could sustain us
through the ‚Äòendless and endlessly boring summer‚Äô of utopia.

::: {.notes}

* How many propositions can you identify?

* How many true or false statements?

But let's imagine, for instance, that one part is true and the other false.

:::

---

* In Bernard Suits‚Äô *The Grasshopper* and *Return of the Grasshopper*,

1. game-play is claimed to be the ‚Äòideal of existence‚Äô

and

2. the only activity that could sustain us through the ‚Äòendless and endlessly boring summer‚Äô of utopia.

::: {.notes}

Perhaps a brief aside on the use of scope in logical operators. What does the attributions of true or false cover?

Another aside, and something we will return to, so remember this, but let's imagine that 1) is true, but 2) is false.

3. game-play is claimed to be the ‚Äòideal of existence‚Äô ***$\land$*** the only activity that could sustain us through the ‚Äòendless and endlessly boring summer‚Äô of utopia.

::: {.notes}

Hopefully, you can see the conditional operator there.

> Christopher Yorke has challenged these claims by way of a constructive dilemma. If these
games are sufficiently akin to the games we play, then they are not adequate to
the task of rendering immortality tolerable. If these games are importantly
different than the games we play, then, in being ‚Äòunknown and unknowable‚Äô,
they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own
and, so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration.

Here, we have more conditional statements.

* If these games are sufficiently akin to the games we play, then they are not adequate to the task of rendering immortality tolerable.

* If, . . . then

* $\rightarrow$

1. Antecedent: These games are sufficiently akin to the games we play.

2. Consequent: They are not adequate to the task of rendering immortality tolerable.

3. These games are sufficiently akin to the games we play. $\rightarrow$ They are not adequate to the task of rendering immortality tolerable.

::: {.notes}

They cannot aliviate us of our boredom.

Why are they inadequate for alliviating our boredom?

They consequent then, becomes the conclusion of another argument. What is the argument?

:::

---

## But this looks weird and not helpful.

3. P $\rightarrow$ Q

::: {.notes}

Just like above, we replace the propositions with sentence letters.

:::

---

> If these games are importantly different than the games we play, then, in being ‚Äòunknown and unknowable‚Äô,
they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own
and, so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration.

::: {.notes}

Look at this second conditional. First, let's split it into its antecendent and consequent parts.

:::

---

## But . . .,

> If these games are importantly different than the games we play, then, in being ‚Äòunknown and unknowable‚Äô,
they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own
and, so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration.

## A new logical operator

> Christopher Yorke has challenged these claims by way of a constructive dilemma. If these
games are sufficiently akin to the games we play, then they are not adequate to
the task of rendering immortality tolerable. If these games are importantly
different than the games we play, then, in being ‚Äòunknown and unknowable‚Äô,
they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own
and, so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration.

---

* Christopher Yorke has challenged these claims by way of a constructive dilemma.

* Either, or

::: {.notes}

What is a constructive dilemma?

* What is a dilemma?

:::

## Either What?

1. P $\rightarrow$ Q

2. R $\rightarrow$ S

---

> If these games are sufficiently akin to the games we play, then they are not adequate to
the task of rendering immortality tolerable. If these games are importantly
different than the games we play, then, in being ‚Äòunknown and unknowable‚Äô,
they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own
and, so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration.

---

Either,

1. If these games are sufficiently akin to the games we play, then they are not adequate to
the task of rendering immortality tolerable.

Or,

2. If these games are importantly different than the games we play, then, in being ‚Äòunknown and unknowable‚Äô,
they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own
and, so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration.

These games are sufficiently akin to the games we play $\lor$ These games are importantly different than the games we play

---

* Antecedent:

::: {.notes}

If these games are importantly different than the games we play,

---

* Consequent:

then, in being ‚Äòunknown and unknowable‚Äô, they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own and, so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration.

### We can further break down the consequent.

::: {.notes}

What might this look like? How might we further break it down?

:::

---

* then,

* in being ‚Äòunknown and unknowable‚Äô,

* they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own

* and

* so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration.

::: {.notes}

There is something important regarding 'and so' here. Before when we've seen *and*, we said that was a logical operator connecting two propositions. But 'so' seems to change the use of *and* here. What do you think?

:::

---

* and so,

* would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration.

## Let's identify the main components of this argument.

> So, then, no one who understands what God is can conceive that God does not exist; although he says these words in his heart, either without any, or with some, foreign signification. For; God is that than which a greater cannot be conceived. And he who thoroughly understands this assuredly understands that this being so truly exists, that not even in concept can it be nonexistent. Therefore, he who understands that God so exists cannot conceive that he does not exist.

---

### We are going to be looking for:

* ***Propositions*** (Sentences/tf Statements)

* ***Logical Operators*** (Connect Propositions)

* ***Scope*** (Which logical operators apply to which propositions)

---

What might we do next?

* What should we identify first?
