    "section": "",
    "text": "Justice in the ideal city and in the ideal soul\nThe tripartite nature of the city and the soul\n\n\nIn the Republic, Plato tells a story. In the beginning of the story, Socrates, his mentor, is on his way back from the Piraeus after attending a religious festival. The Piraeuseans had recently imported a religious cult which worshiped the Tracian goddess Bendis. A question is raised. What is justice? Over time, varying accounts of justice are offered, each of which Socrates raises objections to (Bk I, 352d-354a). In order to explain his ideal of true justice, Socrates imagines the ideal city (BK IV, 434d-435a). This city is comprised of three classes of persons. Justice is achieved when each class, performs that role in the city, to which they are best suited. The working class is motivated by the pursuit of material wealth (558d-559c), the guardian class is motivated by honor (BK III, 414b), and the ruling class is motivated by truth (BK III, 412b-414b).\nAccordingly, justice in the human soul, which is tripartite, is achieved when each part of the soul performs that role to which it is best suited. The appetites, perform those roles necessary for the base functions of the human person, food, procreation, and other necessary motor functions. The passions, or emotions are mobilized with respect to honor or respect, and its pursuit. Reason, which ought to rule over both the appetites and emotions, is concerned with an unyielding pursuit of truth.\n\n\n\n\nWhat virtues belong to each class?\nWhat is the first class that Plato discusses?\n\n\nOddly enough, in Bk III, Plato leaves off any discussion of what he calls poetry, because even though he is convinced that poetry disrupts the training of the just sole, he cannot say how it does so until he has defined justice. This part of the project takes from Bk III to Bk IVX to do. While his conclusion is that art can disrupt this ideal ordering of the tripartite self, it is not until we get to Bk X to see how this is possible.\n\n\nArtists, most notably the poets, are often cited as teachers of virtue. Yet, the most they are capable of is imitation. This brings us to the primary argument in Bk X of the Republic. What is this class of thing which poetry belongs to?\n\n\n\nWhat makes a good teacher of virtue?\nWhat makes a good poet?\n\n\nUnlike other craftsmen, say a carpenter, the artist merely imitates what the craftsman makes, including virtue. But this is only as their mere opinions would lead them to believe of its nature. Imitation involves the mere imitation of craftsmanship.\nFirst, there is the nature of a bed as created by say a god (X, 597b). In exercising their craft, the carpenter makes a bed, which is based on the original form of a bed. Though the craftsman makes a bed, the ideal form of the bed is made by a god. A painter, finally then, exercises a different craft, and their resulting product, likewise differs from the god and the carpenter.\nImportantly here, while the god makes the form of the bed, and the carpenter makes an idealization of this form, the painter, and other artists including poets, only imitate what the craftsmen makes. As such, the products of the artists are at a third remove from the truth (597e).\n\n\n\n\n\nClasses of Objects\nWhat are their purposes?\nWhat are they made of?\nHow do we understand them?\n\n\nWe are looking at a particular class of object. These are objects which are objects that are thought to represent other artifacts, namely those created by artisans.\nPaintings, novels, stories, plays, films, and games. Consider Seurat’s Sunday on the Island of La Grande Jate, or Dicken’s Tale of two Cities, or Hitchcock’s North by Northwest.\nKendall (walt90?) in his book Mimesis as Make-Believe, defines the question nicely. These objects are important for our lives and culture. But what are they? What are they made of? How do they work? What purposes do they serve and how do they serve them? What means do they use to serve these purposes? How do people understand and appreciate them?\nWalton will go on to argue that the kinds of objects that we refer to as mimetic, are best understood as props in games of make believe.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract Concepts\nWhat does Tragedy Represent?\n\n\nImportantly however, Plato’s main target is not the imitation of objects, beds, tables, chairs, etc. Rather, Plato’s primary target is the representation of virtue and other abstract constructs. Socrates and his student Plato, grew up on the narratives provided them by the Greek tragedians, poets, and other literary figures of their day. As pointed out by Martha (nuss86i?), Greek tragedy of the sort that concerns Plato:\nWhat about the Sydney Opera House, paintings by Jason Pollack, or images created by game developers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngood people being ruined because of things that just happen to them, things that they do not control. … and ordinary fact of human life. (nuss86i?)\n\n\nWhile Plato’s concern is the existence of human virtue here, the above preoccupation does not express Plato’s criticism fully. People do not typically loose their virtue because of some environmental catastrophe. The environment might obscure some important fact that contributed to the person’s decision for instance, meaning the person involved might be excused in part because of ignorance. Additional, we often see great acts of courage, beneficence, selflessness in response to environment catastrophes. But, Greek tragedy did something else as well:\n\n\nBut . . .\n\nWhat is Vice?\nVicious Action done in ignorance or something else?\n\n\n\nTragedy also … shows good people doing bad things, things otherwise repugnant to their ethical character and commitments, because of circumstances whose origin does not lie with them.\n\n\n\nThese lie beyond simple ignorance. Here, the person is fully knowledgeable about what they are doing. They are not being physically or psychologically coerced. Rather, tragedy presents a character as being able to make one of two equally bad choices. The outcome of such stories, is for their audiences to question the nature of human goodness. What can possibly count as human virtue, virtue that is attributable to the person and not the environment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I lack, say the virtue of courage, but possess, say the virtue of painting, could I paint an accurate portrait of said virtue?\nIf I possess, say the virtue of courage, but not the virtue of painting, could I paint an accurate portrait of said virtue?\n\n\nThe reason is this: We hear some people say that poets know all crafts, all human affairs concerned with virtue and vice, and all about the gods as well. They say that if a good poet produces find poetry, he must have knowledge of the things he writes about, or else he wouldn’t be able to produce it at all. [BK X, 598e]\n\n\n\nBoth the teacher of virtue and poet are skilled to some extent. To be skilled, you must first have certain abilities and knowledge. The question which remains is whether what one needs to know in order to be a good teacher of virtue is the same as what one needs to know to be a good poet.\n\nPlato argues these are not analogous. What say you?\n\n\nPlato argues these are not analogous."

    "text": "As the following quote shows, Bonaventure was not only committed to theology, but philosophy which according to him, was to better understand the beliefs he held. It is important to note, that philosophy was important even for what he considered matters of faith, which at times, is thought to be immune from the critical reflections that philosophy enables.\n\nAnd so, if the writings of the philosophers are sometimes of much value in understanding truth and refuting errors, we are not departing from the purity of faith if we at times study them, especially since there are many questions of faith which cannot be settled without recourse to them. (trans. Monti 1994: 53)\n\nFrom 1243 to 1248, Bonaventure studied theology at the university of Paris. During the course of his studies, he worked with the Fransiscans, a group of Catholic organizations founded by St. Fransis of Assisi, a town in Italy, in the year 1209. Bonaventure became a Formed Bachelor which meant that he would take on the academic roles of lecturing, getting involved in university disputers, and preaching. While a formed bachelor, not yet a master, the university’s masters and its students when on strike, leading to them becoming expelled. During this conflict, Bonaventure would be elected to the Fransiscan Chair in theology though he would only teach at the Fransiscan convent which was not recognized by the University.\nThere would be some controversy surrounding this since, though the duties Bonaventure performed where those of a Master, he was not recognized as one until 1256 by order of Pope Alexander IV. During this time however, Bonaventure was a prolific scholar producing many texts including his Reduction of Arts to Theology which was a reflection on theological sermons as a genre of art.\n\nThe same mode of reasoning is found in On Retracing the Arts to Theology. Here “reduction” consists in developing analogies that move the mind from the liberal arts to theology and back again. Bonaventure argues for each point by combining one claim based on reason with another based on revelation, as though they were wall and buttress of the cathedral of theology. Philosophical reasoning, then, is an absolutely integral part of Bonaventure’s faith-based theology.\n\n\nThe world as it is revealed to us through the senses provides the means for our re-entering ourselves and ascending to higher things. Furthermore, the senses themselves are equally signs of higher things.\n\n\nexercising their powers of intellect and will, intellectual creatures discover the highest and most perfect object of their powers in the Divine Source of their being, since God is the First or Highest Truth and the First or Chief Good. Accordingly, intellectual creatures have God as their ultimate object, whereas all creatures have God as their Cause. Consequently, intellectual creatures show themselves to be “images” and “likenesses” of God, while they show that all creatures are “shadows” and “vestiges” of God.\n\n\nThe resolution of all our items of simple apprehension into the concept of being is metaphysically and epistemologically crucial: metaphysically, it opens up a route of argumentation that leads to the existence of God; epistemologically, such a resolution means that behind all, even the most determinate and specific, conceptions of things lies a transcendental awareness of being that informs all of our knowledge.",

    "text": "Saint Thomas Aquinas is often referred to as “Aristotle baptised”. Much of his inspiration comes from the Greek philosopher. Each time that you read “the philosopher” in the Summa, substitute it with Aristotle. For instance, in objection 3 or Article five of Question 5, Aquinas says:\nJust like ‘the philosopher’ refers to the person, luckily for us, the work written by the philosopher is cited for us. This reference cites Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, bk vii, chapter 13. In this chapter, Aristotle defends his view that happiness is the Supreme Good. The supreme good means the end of every human activity, the aim of all action is to pursue happiness.\nIn question 5, Aquinas confront the question about whether happiness can be achieved by us. As you probably know by now, whatever Aquinas’ position on a subject is, is first preceded by three opposing views, and then these are disputed, with an explanation following this dispute followed up by 3 responses to the three opposing views. While this form appears simple, there is a lot of nuance that occurs. Additionally, it would help to know more intimately, the material Aquinas is working against, for instance the Nicomachean Ethics.\nWe’ve seen other treatises on happiness, for instance it was covered by Augustine.",

This means that everything in nature has a purpose or end (telos) that it is directed towards.\nThis include:\n\nends\ngoals\nand purposes\n\n\nBut what are these and do we necessarily have access to them? The person who intends to rob a bank because it is enjoyable, is that person really pursuing the goal of robbery? Or is the goal something else? Is the goal of robbery really enjoyment?

    "text": "Article 1\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in wealth. For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Polit. i, 3), viz., natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a remedy for his natural wants, such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, dwellings, and such like; while artificial wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.\n\n\nNow it is evident that man’s happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz., as a support of human nature. Consequently, it cannot be man’s last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such things are below man and made for him, according to Psalm 8: “Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.”\n\n\nAnd as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth, since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently, much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore, it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth."

    "text": "Article 4\n\nOn the contrary, Happiness is the perfect good. But power is most imperfect. For as Boethius says (De Consol. iii), “the power of man cannot relieve the gnawings of care, nor can it avoid the thorny path of anxiety.” And further on: “Think you a man is powerful who is surrounded by attendants, whom he inspires with fear indeed, but whom he fears still more?” Therefore, happiness does not consist in power.\n\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for happiness to consist in power; and this for two reasons. First because power has the nature of principle, as is stated in [Aristotle’s] Metaph. v, 12, whereas happiness has the nature of last end. Second, because power has relation to good and evil, whereas happiness is man’s proper and perfect good. Wherefore some happiness might consist in the good use of power, which is by virtue, rather than in power itself."

But honor is not in the honored, but rather in him who honors, and who offers deference to the person honored, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 5). Therefore, happiness does not consist in honor.\n\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for happiness to consist in honor. For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and consequently, it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the person honored. Now a man’s excellence is in proportion, especially, to his happiness, which is man’s perfect good; and to its parts, i.e., those goods by which he has a certain share of happiness. And therefore honor can result from happiness, but happiness cannot principally consist therein."

For those who receive false fame, must needs blush at their own praise.” Therefore, man’s happiness does not consist in fame or glory. […]\n\n\nReply to Objection 3: Fame has no stability; in fact, it is easily ruined by false report. And if sometimes it endures, this is by accident. But happiness endures of itself, and forever."

    "section": "Article 5",
    "text": "Article 5\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in the goods of the body, and this for two reasons. First, because if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz., to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason, according to Ecclus. 15:14: “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel.” Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end, since man is not the supreme good. Therefore, the last end of man’s reason and will cannot be the preservation of man’s being.\nSecond, because, granted [for the sake of argument] that the end of man’s will and reason be the preservation of man’s being, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. For man’s being consists in soul and body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above [ST I, q. 75, a. 2]; and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end. Consequently, happiness, which is man’s last end, cannot consist in goods of the body."

    "text": "Article 7\nI answer that, As stated above [ST I-II, q. 1, a. 8], the end is twofold: namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use, namely, the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak of man’s last end as to the thing itself which we desire as last end, it is impossible for man’s last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually from being potentially knowing, and actually virtuous from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is for the sake of actuality as for its fulfillment, that which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore, the soul itself cannot be its own last end.\nIn like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit, or act. For that good which is the last end is the perfect good fulfilling the desire. Now man’s appetite, otherwise [known as] the will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore, none of them can be man’s last end."

For happiness is the perfect good, which lulls the appetite altogether; else it would not be the last end, if something yet remained to be desired. Now the object of the will, i.e., of man’s appetite, is the universal good; just as the object of the intellect is the universal true. Hence it is evident that naught can lull man’s will save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone, because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Psalm 102: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.” Therefore, God alone constitutes man’s happiness."

    "text": "Star Citizen is a mass multiplayer online game set 900 years in the future. As a narrative, it explores concepts such as exploration and colonization. Although human societies are not in a position within this imagined future to colonize other alien civilizations, there are similar themes explored through the various narrative arcs such as indentured servitude, civil rights, the reach of law. Unlike other games which emphasize their pursuit of such themes, these themes are merely hinted at.\nThe center of focus for Star Citizen’s developers and audience, is pursuit and definition of agency. Star Citizen is largely an open world game, more akin to the Sims than it is to Mass Effect. The game play it embodies is merely a suggestion.\nThe draw for engagement is not a given narrative vision, but rather that it provides a space where a community of players can design and define their own ideal game play. Star Citizen’s developers do not invite their community to come and be entertained, nor is the community invited to come and witness the expression of a given narrative. Rather, the community is invited to come and create a shared narrative, to participate through active contribution rather than passive consummation.\n\n\n\nThe artistic and technical sophistication of video games have grown immensely in the last decade.\n\nBut here we should focus on the technical growth of video games, and contrast this against the artistic growth.\n\n\n\nfictional environment\nemphasized agency of the player\nchoose to engage in game’s narrative\nor to explore dungeons and go on quests\nor refrain from engagement in the game’s narrative\nExplores agency\n\nEven in refraining from engagement in the game’s narrative, game play, exploring and other basic engagement is emotionally, and aesthetically, rewarding.

    "section": "The Philosophy of Art",
    "text": "The Philosophy of Art\n\nExcludes questions about beauty of nature, beauty more generally.\nBeauty of art then?\n\n\n\nArtistic beauty stands higher than natural because of its connection to the mind.\nWhy? Can only mind perceive truth? As such, there is no truth in nature.\n\n\nMind, and mind only, is capable of truth, and comprehends in itself all that is, so that whatever is beautiful can only be really and truly beautiful as partaking in this higher element and as created thereby. [218]\n\n\n\nTherefore:\n\nbeauty of nature reveals itself as but a reflection of the beauty which belongs to the mind, as an imperfect, incomplete mode of being … whose substantial element is contained in the mind itself. [218]\n\n\n\nWhat is the science of beauty then?\nFirst consider whether art is:\n\nA necessity, practical (for morality and piety)\nOr only a luxury (entertainment)\n\n\nOne is a kind of reason\nThe other sensuality\n\n\nWhat is wrong with this characterization?\n\nnothing is gained for reason and duty by the attempt at mediation, because these principles, as essentially incapable of intermixture, can be parties to no such compromise, but demand in their manifestation the same purity which they have in themselves. [219]\n\n\n\n\n\nArt as Necessity or Luxury\n\nIt seems that at best, it is pleasing amusement only\n\nBut,\n\n\nThe beauty of art presents itself to sense, to feeling, to perception, to imagination; its sphere is not that of thought, and the apprehension of its activity and its productions demand another organ than that of the scientific intelligence. [219]\n\n\n\nThe beauty of art lies in truth, which is different from pleasing amusement\n\nand so,\n\nthe organ of artistic activity and enjoymnet — is of necessity excluded from science. . . . seeing that art is what cheers and animates the dull and withered dryness of the idea, reconciles with reality its abstraction and its dissociation therefrom, and supplies out of the real world what is lacking to the notion, . . . [219]\n\n\n\nHeiddegger, The Thingly Nature of Art\n\n\n\nA Stop sign against the backdrop of the California coast\n\n\n\nSome objects are things.\nWhen looking at objects that are things, we can play a fun game with ourselves: art or not?\n\n\n\nOur aim is to arrive at the immediate and full reality of the work of art, for only in this way shall we discover real art also within it. [398]\n\n\nWe can begin with understanding what a thing is by focusing on its function, its practical use.\n\nWhat is a mere thing?\n\nThere are three considerations here:\nPractical Use,\nHistorical Constitution, they establish a sense of history and time giving them cultural significance.\nThereby, they build our world around us.\nWhat is time without its passage?\n\n\nMere Things\n\nA block of granite for instance\nA stop sign? Is this a mere thing? No.\n\n\nA stop sign is practically useful.\n\n\n\n\n\nA Pair of Shoes 1886\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Artistic Achievement?\n\n\nWhen does a work succeed as art?\nand correspondingly, when does it fail?\nBy understanding this, when does a game succeed as a game? But more importantly, when does it become art?\n\n\n\nWhat is Artistic Sophistication?\n\n\n\nIs it a form of artistic achievement?\nIs it merely an accounting of the increasingly technological sophistication of modern games?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Beta is three-dimensional. Stars are shown as colored dots - the shades of which can be changed to represent different sorts of data:\n\n\nsecurity status,\nservices,\nsovereignty,\nnumber of pilots in space\n\n\nand many others. Lines show the jump gate connections between stars, with the path from your current location to the selected system shown as a dotted line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is important here is the quantification of data. Each pixel is embueded with large quantifies of information that have significance and represent meaning beyond the game itself.\nEach aspect of data here represents not only an artifact created by a game developer, but those artifacts that are created by the players themselves.\nFor each ship to exist in this game, there first needs to be material mined from asteroids, then refined. The refined materials are then made into base components like different kinds of metal.\n\n\n\n\nIn the EVE universe, the vast majority of items are manufactured by player characters and traded in a relatively free way in the marketplace. Students of economics will note that these markets are neither perfect nor efficient in the technical senses; volumes of many items are low enough that the market can be (and is) manipulated, and the supply of materials and modules is partly provided by loot drops in missions, which can be adjusted without warning by the game developers. Similarly, the developers may adjust the requirements for a manufacturing process, or increase the availability of ore, or otherwise mess in the sandbox.\n\n\nNonetheless, manufacturing and selling items can provide interest and ISK profit for the careful and canny player. The player must be aware, however, that there are plenty of items that destroy value - that is, there are a great number of Tech 1 items, modules especially, that are worth less than the cost of manufacture. Many more items can be sold at a profit, but only in a limited volume in certain markets. Manufacture in these cases may simply be an alternative to hauling stuff between markets.\n\n\n\n\nArtistic Representation, Injustice, and Exploitation\n\nBut because of the interactive nature of videogame fictions – the player takes a part in the moral situations presented there, and whether or not the evil occurs is often up to them – the potential of games for the exploration of moral issues seems somehow more vivid: and perhaps more dangerous, where the game does not provide opportunities to put the content in a thoughtful or realistic context.\n\n\nBut what happens when developers imbibe there creations with data, and create meaning that we would normally otherwise find reprehensible.\nFor instance, while it is typically obvious that violence is wrong, what is equally worrisome, are the depictions of women and other minorities that we see in GTA San Andreas.\n\n\n\nHere one’s emotional response to some object (an event, person, state of affairs, etc) can properly be held to such evaluations as that it is misdirected, unjustified, abnormal, or somehow an emotion one ought not to have, in general or in the particular case.\n\n\nTherefore, is it possible to enjoy fictions like those found in GTA. We might think not since our enjoyment of them would represent a conflict in interests.\nWe believe that murder is wrong, that people should not be treated as means to an end, but as an end in themselves etc.\n\n\n\nGilmore rejects this arguing that\n\nimaginative activity has an epistemic or practical role like that of beliefs and perceptions, where the function is to aid in, e.g., planning for the future, or discovering some truth about the actual world, our evaluative commitments, or what is metaphysically possible. (Gilmore 2020, 132)\n\n\n\nArtistic Functions\n\nMy explanation was that the kinds of reasons that we countenance as justifying our emotions, imaginings, and desires depend on the functions of the practices in which those mental representations are elicited. (Gilmore 2020, 201)\n\n\n\nEntertainment\nAbsorption\nVicarious Experience\nDistraction\n\nBack to an earlier question, how do we qualify artistic achievement?\n\n\n\nHowever, when we evaluate a work of art in light of its acheievement of its ends, taht evaluation is typically not based on merely the discharging of those ends, without regard to how that happens to occurr. Our interest is rather in the ends as realized by the means: that is, how the material or structural medium of the work discharges a function. (Gilmore 2020, 205)\n\n\n\nThis model has been argued to make sense of the distinction between ‘punk’ and ‘real punk’ in that the conditions to qualify as punk tend to be descriptive, but an artist and their work must embody the values of punk to qualify as ‘real punk’ (Liao, Meskin, Knobe 2020).

    "text": "What is Artistic Sophistication?\n\n\n\nIs it a form of artistic achievement?\nIs it merely an accounting of the increasingly technological sophistication of modern games?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMap Beta is three-dimensional. Stars are shown as colored dots - the shades of which can be changed to represent different sorts of data:\n\n\nsecurity status,\nservices,\nsovereignty,\nnumber of pilots in space\n\n\nand many others. Lines show the jump gate connections between stars, with the path from your current location to the selected system shown as a dotted line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is important here is the quantification of data. Each pixel is embueded with large quantifies of information that have significance and represent meaning beyond the game itself.\nEach aspect of data here represents not only an artifact created by a game developer, but those artifacts that are created by the players themselves.\nFor each ship to exist in this game, there first needs to be material mined from asteroids, then refined. The refined materials are then made into base components like different kinds of metal.\n\n\n\n\nIn the EVE universe, the vast majority of items are manufactured by player characters and traded in a relatively free way in the marketplace. Students of economics will note that these markets are neither perfect nor efficient in the technical senses; volumes of many items are low enough that the market can be (and is) manipulated, and the supply of materials and modules is partly provided by loot drops in missions, which can be adjusted without warning by the game developers. Similarly, the developers may adjust the requirements for a manufacturing process, or increase the availability of ore, or otherwise mess in the sandbox.\n\n\nNonetheless, manufacturing and selling items can provide interest and ISK profit for the careful and canny player. The player must be aware, however, that there are plenty of items that destroy value - that is, there are a great number of Tech 1 items, modules especially, that are worth less than the cost of manufacture. Many more items can be sold at a profit, but only in a limited volume in certain markets. Manufacture in these cases may simply be an alternative to hauling stuff between markets.",

    "text": "3. Establishing Genre Boundaries\nThe third element of this work includes the establishment and employment of genre.\n\nFor Aristotle, genre is a scheme of enquiry that seeks to provide conditions through which mimetic concepts such as media, mimetic objects, and modes are delimited. In other words, he develops:\nConditions for categorizing this class of object\nConcepts that relate to this class of object\nModes of inquiry in which to explore items in this class of object\n\n\n\nasserts the significance of formal design and unity for both the composition and the appreciation of literary works, and to offer a conception of artistic form which relates it to the organic forms crucial to his understanding of nature. [(hall95?), 10; 50b34-51a6]\n\n\n\nAlthough we might call this approach ‘formalist’, a question arises about the necessity of genre concepts inferred in a particular mimetic example.\n\nFor instance, he references Plato’s analysis of mimetic modes in Ch. III of this work.\nHowever, for Aristotle, mimesis is an attempt to understand the broader world, by reference to the human propensity to represent human experiences through fictive representation, and imaginative reenactment.\nIn this way, Aristotle likely hopes to connect art to human nature as a capacity for human desire to understand universal concepts whether moral, religious, ethical, or relational.",

More central to scholarly focus on his writings, are typically his theological claims, epistemology, what can be known and how, and his philosophy of mind, his theses of concepualizing the difference between soul and body. However, De Musica provides a unique insight into Augustine’s reflections on the role of music in his own conversion and other spiritual experiences. He begines with what might be called a commandment, or psychological admonition.\n\n\n\nPerception of the beautiful\nand its constrast against perception of evil\nHow to do it?\n\n\nThis is an important claim. Consider two kinds of non-profit organizations. One is defined by all the things it is against, e.g., anti-war, anti-poverty, anti-racism, etc. The other defines itself by all the things that it is for, to promote peace, love, unity, etc.\nBut from his claims about perception, are those about what improves perception in such a way that it contributes to memory. Namely, we have first two kinds of event. Augustine admonishes us to focus on beautiful events and not ugly ones. But what are some practical ways in which we can focus on the one and not the other? While perception through experience enables one kind of reflection, there are other kinds of reflection that we are capable of, even if we have not had the experience.\nAlso as important, one aspect of what enables the right kind and object of perception, has to do with reflection. Is reflection merely a kind of perception where there is some object that once was external but now is internalized? For instance, consider what his says about the differences between his knowledge of his father and grandfather.\n\n\n\n\nI think differently about my father whom I have seen and about my grandfather whom I have never seen. My thought of my father comes from memory, but my thought of my grandfather comes from mental movements arising out of other mental movements which are contained in memory.\n\n\n\nWhen considering what kinds of reflections we are capable of, the next question is how do we improve our ability to reflect on the beautiful and not the ugly? For Augustine, this is the place of music and why God has given us the capacity for music. But in order to understand why music, we have to first think about what music is.\n\n\n\nOur rhythmic or metric art, which is used by makers of verses, comprises certain rhythmical measurements according to which they make the verses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of wave, distance traveled over period of time\n\n\n\nFor Augustine, there is an important relationship between random sounds, and time. What is the difference between a musical note, say ‘A’ as produced by the strike of a hammer on a piano string, and a child striking a mallet on a taut piece of wire? It helps to understand something about the metaphysics of music here. For instance, we might know that what we experience as sound, is a collection of vibrations either through the air, or another medium such as a piece of wood or metal. We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz.",

We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz.",

While his conclusion is that art can disrupt this ideal ordering of the tripartite self, it is not until we get to Bk X to see how this is possible.\n\n\nArtists, most notably the poets, are often cited as teachers of virtue.

For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Polit. i, 3), viz., natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a remedy for his natural wants, such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, dwellings, and such like; while artificial wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.\n\n\nNow it is evident that man’s happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz., as a support of human nature. Consequently, it cannot be man’s last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such things are below man and made for him, according to Psalm 8: “Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.”\n\n\nAnd as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth, since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently, much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore, it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth."

First because power has the nature of principle, as is stated in [Aristotle’s] Metaph. v, 12, whereas happiness has the nature of last end. Second, because power has relation to good and evil, whereas happiness is man’s proper and perfect good.

For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and consequently, it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the person honored. Now a man’s excellence is in proportion, especially, to his happiness, which is man’s perfect good; and to its parts, i.e., those goods by which he has a certain share of happiness.

    "section": "Article 5",
    "text": "Article 5\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in the goods of the body, and this for two reasons. First, because if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz., to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason, according to Ecclus. 15:14: “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel.” Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end, since man is not the supreme good. Therefore, the last end of man’s reason and will cannot be the preservation of man’s being.\nSecond, because, granted [for the sake of argument] that the end of man’s will and reason be the preservation of man’s being, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. For man’s being consists in soul and body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above [ST I, q. 75, a. 2]; and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end. Consequently, happiness, which is man’s last end, cannot consist in goods of the body."

If, then, we speak of man’s last end as to the thing itself which we desire as last end, it is impossible for man’s last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually from being potentially knowing, and actually virtuous from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is for the sake of actuality as for its fulfillment, that which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore, the soul itself cannot be its own last end.\nIn like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit, or act. For that good which is the last end is the perfect good fulfilling the desire. Now man’s appetite, otherwise [known as] the will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore, none of them can be man’s last end."

Now the object of the will, i.e., of man’s appetite, is the universal good; just as the object of the intellect is the universal true. Hence it is evident that naught can lull man’s will save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone, because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Psalm 102: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.” Therefore, God alone constitutes man’s happiness."

If there are sub-arguments, the premises for these are clear, and made in single statements. The premises which are taken as given are at least plausibly true.\nThe premises are all clear, although each may not be presented in a single statement. It is also pretty clear which premises are to be taken as given, and which will be supported by sub-arguments. The paper provides sub-arguments for controversial premises. If there are sub-arguments, the premises for these are clear. The premises which are taken as given are at least plausibly true.\nThe premises must be reconstructed from the text of the paper. It is not made clear which premises are to be taken as given, and which will be supported by sub-arguments. There are no sub-arguments, or, if there are sub-arguments, the premises for these are not made clear. The paper does not provide sub-arguments for controversial premises. The plausibility of the premises which are taken as given is questionable.\nThere are no premises—the paper merely restates the thesis. Or, if there are premises, they are much more likely to be false than true.\n\n\n\nSupport\nThe premises clearly support the thesis, and the author is aware of exactly the kind of support they provide. The argument is either valid as it stands, or, if invalid, the thesis, based on the premises, is likely to be or plausibly true.\nThe premises support the thesis, and the author is aware of the general kind of support they provide. The argument is either valid as it stands, or, if invalid, the thesis, based on the premises, is likely to be or plausibly true.\nThe premises somewhat support the thesis, but the author is not aware of the kind of support they provide. The argument is invalid, and the thesis, based on the premises, is not likely to be or plausibly true.\nThe premises do not support the thesis.\n\n\n\nStudent Response\nThe paper considers both obvious and unobvious counter-examples, counter-arguments, and/or opposing positions, and provides original and/or thoughtful responses.\nThe paper considers obvious counter-examples, counter-arguments, and/or opposing positions, and provides responses.\nThe paper may consider some obvious counter-examples, counter-arguments, and/or opposing positions, but some obvious ones are missed. Responses are non-existent or mere claims of refutation.\nNo counter-examples, counter-arguments, or opposing positions are considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Points: 640 points, distributed as above.\n\nFormula: Raw scores summed across sheets; final percentage = SUM(all assignment points)/640 * 100.\n\nLetter Grade:\nFinal grade uses the following scale (no rounding):\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA+\n97–100%\n\n\nA\n93–96%\n\n\nA-\n90–92%\n\n\nB+\n87–89%\n\n\nB\n83–86%\n\n\nB-\n80–82%\n\n\nC+\n77–79%\n\n\nC\n73–76%\n\n\nC-\n70–72%\n\n\nD+\n67–69%\n\n\nD\n63–66%\n\n\nD-\n60–62%\n\n\nF\n&lt;60%\n\n\n\nExample: Perfect scores = 32 + 160 + 160 + 80 + 80 + 96 + 32 = 640 points (100%, A+).\n\n\n\n\n\n📍 Lecture\nSee Class Times Below\n\n\n💻 Class Groups\n\n\n📆 Mondays and Wednesdays\n⌚ 10:30am - 11:45am"

We will ask about the relationships between art, art criticism, excellence in art and the human experience of beauty. We will consider how all of this works in modernity: a world of mass production, museums, commercial appropriation of art, and ubiquitous reproductions of works of art."

    "section": "",
    "text": "As the following quote shows, Bonaventure was not only committed to theology, but philosophy which according to him, was to better understand the beliefs he held. It is important to note, that philosophy was important even for what he considered matters of faith, which at times, is thought to be immune from the critical reflections that philosophy enables.\n\nAnd so, if the writings of the philosophers are sometimes of much value in understanding truth and refuting errors, we are not departing from the purity of faith if we at times study them, especially since there are many questions of faith which cannot be settled without recourse to them. (trans. Monti 1994: 53)\n\nFrom 1243 to 1248, Bonaventure studied theology at the university of Paris. During the course of his studies, he worked with the Fransiscans, a group of Catholic organizations founded by St. Fransis of Assisi, named for the town in Italy where he was born in the year 1209. At the University of Paris, Bonaventure became a Formed Bachelor which meant that he would take on the academic roles of lecturing, getting involved in the disputes, a class of philosophical questions rooted in theology, and preaching. While a formed bachelor, not yet a master, the university’s masters and its students when on strike, leading to them becoming expelled. During this conflict, Bonaventure would be elected to the Fransiscan Chair in theology though he would only teach at the Fransiscan convent which was not recognized by the University.\nThere would be some controversy surrounding this since, though the duties Bonaventure performed where those of a Master, he was not recognized as one until 1256 by order of Pope Alexander IV. During this time however, Bonaventure was a prolific scholar producing many texts including his Reduction of Arts to Theology which is a reflection on theological sermons as a genre of art.\n\nThe same mode of reasoning is found in On Retracing the Arts to Theology. Here “reduction” consists in developing analogies that move the mind from the liberal arts to theology and back again. Bonaventure argues for each point by combining one claim based on reason with another based on revelation, as though they were wall and buttress of the cathedral of theology. Philosophical reasoning, then, is an absolutely integral part of Bonaventure’s faith-based theology.1(https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bonaventure/#BonaIlluArgu)\n\nThere are objects we access through our senses. Importantly for Bonaventure, these objects always point towards their source of being, God. But it is not merely the objects in themselves, but rather our apprehension of their “weight, number, and measure” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, that causes us to contemplate their “measure, beauty, and order” and to delight in this aspect of all that is created.\n\nThe world as it is revealed to us through the senses provides the means for our re-entering ourselves and ascending to higher things. Furthermore, the senses themselves are equally signs of higher things.\n\nWhat is important about works of art, whether involving the manipulation of materials such as painting or sculpting, or of the manipulation of words such as speech, is that these act on our spiritual senses. What is created, is a likeness of that object through our faculty of reason.\n\nEach sensible object generates a likeness of itself in the medium through which it is perceived, and that likeness in turn generates another likeness successively in the sense organ, causing the sense power to apprehend the sensible object.\n\nThis is a common understanding, notably evoking a common debate among philosophers. The debate between empiricists and rationalists, is whether, and to what degree do we have a connection to the outside world. For instance, consider this reflection by the philosopher Bertrand Russell:\n\nTo the eye it is oblong, brown and shiny, to the touch it is smooth and cool and hard; when I tap it, it gives out a wooden sound. Anyone else who sees and feels and hears the table will agree with this description, so that it might seem that no difficulty would arise.2\n\nRussell then concludes that all truly have access to is not the table itself, but instead a collection of unique and disconnected perceptions. We see the shape, we touch coolness, we hear the hollow sound, but we do not perceive the table..\n\nit becomes evident that the real table, if there is one, is not the same as what we immediately experience by sight or touch or hearing.3\n\nFor Bonaventure, the resulting object as created by God, is perceived by us through God’s divine light. In other words, when we perceive objects, and delight in them as created objects, we join in union with God, and are able to perceive his creation.\n\nexercising their powers of intellect and will, intellectual creatures discover the highest and most perfect object of their powers in the Divine Source of their being, since God is the First or Highest Truth and the First or Chief Good. Accordingly, intellectual creatures have God as their ultimate object, whereas all creatures have God as their Cause. Consequently, intellectual creatures show themselves to be “images” and “likenesses” of God, while they show that all creatures are “shadows” and “vestiges” of God.\n\nAll at once then, Bonaventure’s project is epistmelogical and metaphysical. It is meant to explain how we know things, and what the nature of those things are.\n\nThe resolution of all our items of simple apprehension into the concept of being is metaphysically and epistemologically crucial: metaphysically, it opens up a route of argumentation that leads to the existence of God; epistemologically, such a resolution means that behind all, even the most determinate and specific, conceptions of things lies a transcendental awareness of being that informs all of our knowledge.\n\nAs such, this is two parts of Bonaventure’s project, but there is a third part as well. The moral project has to do with how we behave. For Bonaventure, this is also guided by the light of God’s divine illumination. Here, it is important to focus on the non-physical aspects of our existence, namely our relationships with one another.\nHow do we develop this?\n\nTherefore, considering the illumination of mechanical skill as regards the production of the work, we shall see therein the Word begotten and made incarnate, that is, the Divinity and the Humanity and the integrity of all faith.\n\nAs the following quote shows, Bonaventure was not only committed to theology, but philosophy which according to him, was to better understand the beliefs he held. It is important to note, that philosophy was important even for what he considered matters of faith, which at times, is thought to be immune from the critical reflections that philosophy enables.\n\nAnd so, if the writings of the philosophers are sometimes of much value in understanding truth and refuting errors, we are not departing from the purity of faith if we at times study them, especially since there are many questions of faith which cannot be settled without recourse to them.

This means that everything in nature has a purpose or end (telos) that it is directed towards.\nThis include:\n\nends\ngoals\nand purposes\n\n\nBut what are these and do we necessarily have access to them? The person who intends to rob a bank because it is enjoyable, is that person really pursuing the goal of robbery? Or is the goal something else? Is the goal of robbery really enjoyment? If so, then what is the goal of enjoyment? Is it pleasure? If so, then what is the goal of pleasure? Is it happiness? If so, then what is the goal of happiness?"

    "text": "Article 1\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in wealth. For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Polit. i, 3), viz., natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a remedy for his natural wants, such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, dwellings, and such like; while artificial wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.\n\n\nNow it is evident that man’s happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz., as a support of human nature. Consequently, it cannot be man’s last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such things are below man and made for him, according to Psalm 8: “Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.”\n\n\nAnd as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth, since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently, much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore, it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth."

    "text": "Article 4\n\nOn the contrary, Happiness is the perfect good. But power is most imperfect. For as Boethius says (De Consol. iii), “the power of man cannot relieve the gnawings of care, nor can it avoid the thorny path of anxiety.” And further on: “Think you a man is powerful who is surrounded by attendants, whom he inspires with fear indeed, but whom he fears still more?” Therefore, happiness does not consist in power.\n\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for happiness to consist in power; and this for two reasons. First because power has the nature of principle, as is stated in [Aristotle’s] Metaph. v, 12, whereas happiness has the nature of last end. Second, because power has relation to good and evil, whereas happiness is man’s proper and perfect good. Wherefore some happiness might consist in the good use of power, which is by virtue, rather than in power itself."

But honor is not in the honored, but rather in him who honors, and who offers deference to the person honored, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 5). Therefore, happiness does not consist in honor.\n\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for happiness to consist in honor. For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and consequently, it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the person honored. Now a man’s excellence is in proportion, especially, to his happiness, which is man’s perfect good; and to its parts, i.e., those goods by which he has a certain share of happiness. And therefore honor can result from happiness, but happiness cannot principally consist therein."

    "section": "Article 5",
    "text": "Article 5\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in the goods of the body, and this for two reasons. First, because if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz., to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason, according to Ecclus. 15:14: “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel.” Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end, since man is not the supreme good. Therefore, the last end of man’s reason and will cannot be the preservation of man’s being.\nSecond, because, granted [for the sake of argument] that the end of man’s will and reason be the preservation of man’s being, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. For man’s being consists in soul and body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above [ST I, q. 75, a. 2]; and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end. Consequently, happiness, which is man’s last end, cannot consist in goods of the body."

    "text": "Article 7\nI answer that, As stated above [ST I-II, q. 1, a. 8], the end is twofold: namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use, namely, the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak of man’s last end as to the thing itself which we desire as last end, it is impossible for man’s last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually from being potentially knowing, and actually virtuous from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is for the sake of actuality as for its fulfillment, that which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore, the soul itself cannot be its own last end.\nIn like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit, or act. For that good which is the last end is the perfect good fulfilling the desire. Now man’s appetite, otherwise [known as] the will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore, none of them can be man’s last end."

For happiness is the perfect good, which lulls the appetite altogether; else it would not be the last end, if something yet remained to be desired. Now the object of the will, i.e., of man’s appetite, is the universal good; just as the object of the intellect is the universal true. Hence it is evident that naught can lull man’s will save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone, because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Psalm 102: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.” Therefore, God alone constitutes man’s happiness."

    "text": "Saint Thomas Aquinas is often referred to as “Aristotle baptised”. Much of his inspiration comes from the Greek philosopher. Each time that you read “the philosopher” in the Summa, substitute it with Aristotle. For instance, in objection 3 or Article five of Question 5, Aquinas says:\nJust like ‘the philosopher’ refers to the person, luckily for us, the work written by the philosopher is cited for us. This reference cites Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics, bk vii, chapter 13. In this chapter, Aristotle defends his view that happiness is the Supreme Good. The supreme good means the end of every human activity, the aim of all action is to pursue happiness.\nIn question 5, Aquinas confront the question about whether happiness can be achieved by us. As you probably know by now, whatever Aquinas’ position on a subject is, is first preceded by three opposing views, and then these are disputed, with an explanation following this dispute followed up by 3 responses to the three opposing views. While this form appears simple, there is a lot of nuance that occurs. Additionally, it would help to know more intimately, the material Aquinas is working against, for instance the Nicomachean Ethics.\nWe’ve seen other treatises on happiness, for instance it was covered by Augustine.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Justice in the ideal city and in the ideal soul\nThe tripartite nature of the city and the soul\n\n\nIn the Republic, Plato tells a story. In the beginning of the story, Socrates, his mentor, is on his way back from the Piraeus after attending a religious festival. The Piraeuseans had recently imported a religious cult which worshiped the Tracian goddess Bendis. A question is raised. What is justice? Over time, varying accounts of justice are offered, each of which Socrates raises objections to (Bk I, 352d-354a). In order to explain his ideal of true justice, Socrates imagines the ideal city (BK IV, 434d-435a). This city is comprised of three classes of persons. Justice is achieved when each class, performs that role in the city, to which they are best suited. The working class is motivated by the pursuit of material wealth (558d-559c), the guardian class is motivated by honor (BK III, 414b), and the ruling class is motivated by truth (BK III, 412b-414b).\nAccordingly, justice in the human soul, which is tripartite, is achieved when each part of the soul performs that role to which it is best suited. The appetites, perform those roles necessary for the base functions of the human person, food, procreation, and other necessary motor functions. The passions, or emotions are mobilized with respect to honor or respect, and its pursuit. Reason, which ought to rule over both the appetites and emotions, is concerned with an unyielding pursuit of truth.\n\n\n\n\nWhat virtues belong to each class?\nWhat is the first class that Plato discusses?\n\n\nOddly enough, in Bk III, Plato leaves off any discussion of what he calls poetry, because even though he is convinced that poetry disrupts the training of the just sole, he cannot say how it does so until he has defined justice. This part of the project takes from Bk III to Bk IVX to do. While his conclusion is that art can disrupt this ideal ordering of the tripartite self, it is not until we get to Bk X to see how this is possible.\n\n\nArtists, most notably the poets, are often cited as teachers of virtue. Yet, the most they are capable of is imitation. This brings us to the primary argument in Bk X of the Republic. What is this class of thing which poetry belongs to?\n\n\n\nWhat makes a good teacher of virtue?\nWhat makes a good poet?\n\n\nUnlike other craftsmen, say a carpenter, the artist merely imitate what the craftsman makes. including virtue, as their mere opinions would lead them to believe of its nature. Imitation involves the mere imitation of craftmenship. First, there is the nature of a bed as created by say a god (X, 597b). In exercising their craft, the carpenter makes a bed, which is based on the original form of a bed. Though the craftman makes a bed, the ideal form of the bed is made by a god. A painter, finally then, exercises a different craft, and their resulting product, likewise differs from the god and the carpenter. Importantly here, while the god makes the form of the bed, and the carpenter makes an idealization fo this form, the painter, and other artists including poets, only imitate what the craftsmen makes. As such, the products of the artists are at a third remove from the truth (597e).\n\n\nWhat are the targets of artistic imitation?\n\nWe are looking at a particular class of object. These are objects which are objects that are thought to represent other artifacts, namely those created by artisans.\nPaintings, novels, stories, plays, films, and games. Consider Seurat’s Sunday on the Island of La Grande Jate, or Dicken’s Tale of two Cities, or Hitchcock’s North by Northwest.\nKendall (walt90?) in his book Mimesis as Make-Believe, defines the question nicely. These objects are important for our lives and culture. But what are they? What are they made of? How do they work? What purposes do they serve and how do they serve them? What means do they use to serve these purposes? How do people understand and appreciate them?\nWalton will go on to argue that the kinds of objects that we refer to as mimetic, are best understood as props in games of make believe.\n\n\n\nImportantly however, Plato’s main target is not the imitation of objects, beds, tables, chairs, etc. Rather, Plato’s primary target is the representation of virtue and other abstract constructs. Socrates and his student Plato, grew up on the narratives provided them by the Greek tragedians, poets, and other literary figures of their day. As pointed out by Martha (nuss86i?), Greek tragedy of the sort that concerns Plato:\nWhat about the Sydney Opera House, paintings by Jason Pollack, or images created by game developers?\n\n\nTragedy does\n\nshows good people being ruined because of things that just happen to them, things that they do not control. … and ordinary fact of human life.\n\n\nWhile Plato’s concern is the existence of human virtue here, the above preoccupation does not express Plato’s criticism fully. People do not typically loose their virtue because of some environmental catastrophe. The environment might obscure some important fact that contributed to the person’s decision for instance, meaning the person involved might be excused in part because of ignorance. Additional, we often see great acts of courage, beneficence, selflessness in response to environment catastrophes. But, Greek tragedy did something else as well:\n\n\nBut . . .\n\n\nTragedy also … shows good people doing bad things, things otherwise repugnant to their ethical character and commitments, because of circumstances whose origin does not lie with them.\n\n\n\nThese lie beyond simple ignorance. Here, the person is fully knowledgeable about what they are doing. They are not being physically or psychologically coerced. Rather, tragedy presents a character as being able to make one of two equally bad choices. The outcome of such stories, is for their audiences to question the nature of human goodness. What can possibly count as human virtue, virtue that is attributable to the person and not the environment?\n\n\nThe skill of the poet and the skill of the moral educator:\n\nThe reason is this: We hear some people say that poets know all crafts, all human affairs concerned with virtue and vice, and all about the gods as well. They say that if a good poet produces find poetry, he must have knowledge of the things he writes about, or else he wouldn’t be able to produce it at all. [BK X, 598e]\n\n\n\nBoth the teacher of virtue and poet are skilled to some extent. To be skilled, you must first have certain abilities and knowledge. The question which remains is whether what one needs to know in order to be a good teacher of virtue is the same as what one needs to know to be a good poet.\n\nPlato argues these are not analogous. What say you?\n\n\nPlato argues these are not analogous."

Can only mind perceive truth? As such, there is no truth in nature.\n\n\nMind, and mind only, is capable of truth, and comprehends in itself all that is, so that whatever is beautiful can only be really and truly beautiful as partaking in this higher element and as created thereby.

More central to scholarly focus on his writings, are typically his theological claims, epistemology, what can be known and how, and his philosophy of mind, his theses of concepualizing the difference between soul and body.

    "text": "Article 1\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for man’s happiness to consist in wealth. For wealth is twofold, as the Philosopher [Aristotle] says (Polit. i, 3), viz., natural and artificial. Natural wealth is that which serves man as a remedy for his natural wants, such as food, drink, clothing, carriages, dwellings, and such like; while artificial wealth is that which is not a direct help to nature, as money, but is invented by the art of man, for the convenience of exchange, and as a measure of things salable.\n\n\nNow it is evident that man’s happiness cannot consist in natural wealth. For wealth of this kind is sought for the sake of something else, viz., as a support of human nature. Consequently, it cannot be man’s last end, rather is it ordained to man as to its end. Wherefore in the order of nature, all such things are below man and made for him, according to Psalm 8: “Thou hast subjected all things under his feet.”\n\n\nAnd as to artificial wealth, it is not sought save for the sake of natural wealth, since man would not seek it except because, by its means, he procures for himself the necessaries of life. Consequently, much less can it be considered in the light of the last end. Therefore, it is impossible for happiness, which is the last end of man, to consist in wealth.",

First because power has the nature of principle, as is stated in [Aristotle’s] Metaph. v, 12, whereas happiness has the nature of last end. Second, because power has relation to good and evil, whereas happiness is man’s proper and perfect good. Wherefore some happiness might consist in the good use of power, which is by virtue, rather than in power itself.",

Therefore, happiness does not consist in honor.\n\n\nI answer that, It is impossible for happiness to consist in honor. For honor is given to a man on account of some excellence in him; and consequently, it is a sign and attestation of the excellence that is in the person honored. Now a man’s excellence is in proportion, especially, to his happiness, which is man’s perfect good; and to its parts, i.e., those goods by which he has a certain share of happiness. And therefore honor can result from happiness, but happiness cannot principally consist therein.",

First, because if a thing be ordained to another as to its end, its last end cannot consist in the preservation of its being. Hence a captain does not intend as a last end the preservation of the ship entrusted to him, since a ship is ordained to something else as its end, viz., to navigation. Now just as the ship is entrusted to the captain that he may steer its course, so man is given over to his will and reason, according to Ecclus. 15:14: “God made man from the beginning and left him in the hand of his own counsel.” Now it is evident that man is ordained to something as his end, since man is not the supreme good. Therefore, the last end of man’s reason and will cannot be the preservation of man’s being.\nSecond, because, granted [for the sake of argument] that the end of man’s will and reason be the preservation of man’s being, it could not be said that the end of man is some good of the body. For man’s being consists in soul and body; and though the being of the body depends on the soul, yet the being of the human soul depends not on the body, as shown above [ST I, q. 75, a. 2]; and the very body is for the soul, as matter for its form, and the instruments for the man that puts them into motion, that by their means he may do his work. Wherefore all goods of the body are ordained to the goods of the soul, as to their end. Consequently, happiness, which is man’s last end, cannot consist in goods of the body.",

    "text": "Article 7\nI answer that, As stated above [ST I-II, q. 1, a. 8], the end is twofold: namely, the thing itself, which we desire to attain, and the use, namely, the attainment or possession of that thing. If, then, we speak of man’s last end as to the thing itself which we desire as last end, it is impossible for man’s last end to be the soul itself or something belonging to it. Because the soul, considered in itself, is as something existing in potentiality: for it becomes knowing actually from being potentially knowing, and actually virtuous from being potentially virtuous. Now since potentiality is for the sake of actuality as for its fulfillment, that which in itself is in potentiality cannot be the last end. Therefore, the soul itself cannot be its own last end.\nIn like manner neither can anything belonging to it, whether power, habit, or act. For that good which is the last end is the perfect good fulfilling the desire. Now man’s appetite, otherwise [known as] the will, is for the universal good. And any good inherent to the soul is a participated good, and consequently a portioned good. Therefore, none of them can be man’s last end.",

For happiness is the perfect good, which lulls the appetite altogether; else it would not be the last end, if something yet remained to be desired. Now the object of the will, i.e., of man’s appetite, is the universal good; just as the object of the intellect is the universal true. Hence it is evident that naught can lull man’s will save the universal good. This is to be found, not in any creature, but in God alone, because every creature has goodness by participation. Wherefore God alone can satisfy the will of man, according to the words of Psalm 102: “Who satisfieth thy desire with good things.” Therefore, God alone constitutes man’s happiness.",

In other words, he develops:\nConditions for categorizing this class of object\nConcepts that relate to this class of object\nModes of inquiry in which to explore items in this class of object\n\n\n\nasserts the significance of formal design and unity for both the composition and the appreciation of literary works, and to offer a conception of artistic form which relates it to the organic forms crucial to his understanding of nature. [(hall95?), 10; 50b34-51a6]\n\n\n\nAlthough we might call this approach ‘formalist’, a question arises about the necessity of genre concepts inferred in a particular mimetic example.\n\nFor instance, he references Plato’s analysis of mimetic modes in Ch. III of this work.\nHowever, for Aristotle, mimesis is an attempt to understand the broader world, by reference to the human propensity to represent human experiences through fictive representation, and imaginative reenactment.\nIn this way, Aristotle likely hopes to connect art to human nature as a capacity for human desire to understand universal concepts whether moral, religious, ethical, or relational.",

    "section": "Two Questions about Perception",
    "text": "Two Questions about Perception\n\nCan we improve the way we perceive the world around us?\nHow does education foster better perception of the world around us?\n\n\nBut from his claims about perception, are those about what improves perception in such a way that it contributes to memory. Namely, we have first two kinds of event. Augustine admonishes us to focus on beautiful events and not ugly ones. But what are some practical ways in which we can focus on the one and not the other? While perception through experience enables one kind of reflection, there are other kinds of reflection that we are capable of, even if we have not had the experience.\nAlso as important, one aspect of what enables the right kind and object of perception, has to do with reflection. Is reflection merely a kind of perception where there is some object that once was external but now is internalized? For instance, consider what his says about the differences between his knowledge of his father and grandfather.\n\n\n\n\nI think differently about my father whom I have seen and about my grandfather whom I have never seen. My thought of my father comes from memory, but my thought of my grandfather comes from mental movements arising out of other mental movements which are contained in memory.\n\n\n\nWhen considering what kinds of reflections we are capable of, the next question is how do we improve our ability to reflect on the beautiful and not the ugly? For Augustine, this is the place of music and why God has given us the capacity for music. But in order to understand why music, we have to first think about what music is.\n\n\n\nOur rhythmic or metric art, which is used by makers of verses, comprises certain rhythmical measurements according to which they make the verses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of wave, distance traveled over period of time\n\n\n\nFor Augustine, there is an important relationship between random sounds, and time. What is the difference between a musical note, say ‘A’ as produced by the strike of a hammer on a piano string, and a child striking a mallet on a taut piece of wire? It helps to understand something about the metaphysics of music here. For instance, we might know that what we experience as sound, is a collection of vibrations either through the air, or another medium such as a piece of wood or metal. We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz.",

And this is by no means so difficult a task as the history of philoso- phy would lead one to suppose. For if there are any questions which science leaves it to philosophy to answer, a straightforward process of elimination must lead to their discovery. [Alfred Jules Ayer, Language, Truth, and Logic]"
