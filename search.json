    "text": "The Artisans and the Poets\n\nWhat virtues belong to each class?\nWhat is the first class that Plato discusses?\n\n\nOddly enough, in Bk III, Plato leaves off any discussion of what he calls poetry, because even though he is convinced that poetry disrupts the training of the just sole, he cannot say how it does so until he has defined justice. This part of the project takes from Bk III to Bk IVX to do. While his conclusion is that art can disrupt this ideal ordering of the tripartite self, it is not until we get to Bk X to see how this is possible.\n\n\nArtists, most notably the poets, are often cited as teachers of virtue. Yet, the most they are capable of is imitation. This brings us to the primary argument in Bk X of the Republic. What is this class of thing which poetry belongs to?"

And this is by no means so difficult a task as the history of philoso- phy would lead one to suppose. For if there are any questions which science leaves it to philosophy to answer, a straightforward process of elimination must lead to their discovery. [Alfred Jules Ayer, Language, Truth, and Logic]"

    "text": "Semantics\n\nSemantics is the Study of Meaning\n\n\n\nHow do you define meaning?\nHow does the book define meaning?\n\n\nThe logical meaning of an expression is usually understood as its contribution to the truth or falsity of sentences in which it occurs. [31]\n\n\nMeaning is a characterization of the meaning of the use of logical operators within a given sentence.\n\nWhat this correlates to, I think, is a question about how a logical operator attirbutes truth or falsehood to a sentence.\nFor instance, in what situations would the sentence “James knows that God exists” be true?\nHow might we imagine various sentences that confirm the truth of P?\n\nOne day, I asked James ‘do you know who God is?’ He said yes and then pointed down at a rock. I then asked James ‘does God exist?’ Again he pointed down at the rock and said yes, ‘God exists’.\n\nIs the sentence ‘James knows God exists’, true in this situation?\nIn otherwords, the meaning of a term is its ‘truth conditions’\nWhat are truth conditions? The meaning of a term. Conditions on which a proposition is true or false.\n\nThe truth conditions for a term are rules which specify the possible situations in which sentences containing that term are true and the possible situations in which sentences containing that term are false.\n\n\nIn this section, we will give the truth-conditional semantics for the five logical operators introduced in the previous section."

Christopher Yorke has challenged these claims by way of a constructive dilemma. If these games are sufficiently akin to the games we play, then they are not adequate to the task of rendering immortality tolerable. If these games are importantly different than the games we play, then, in being ‘unknown and unknowable’, they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own and, so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration. Against Yorke’s skepticism, I argue that the games that constitute the ideal of existence are intelligible to us because we already play what the Grasshopper calls ‘open games’. Steffen Borge concedes that utopian games are intelligible, but argues that such games would fail to ‘grab our minds and imagination’. In the second half of the paper, I contend, against Borge, that such open games are adequate to the task of sustaining the interest of an immortal community."

In order to state the formation rules for propositional logic, we need first to define the character set for propositional logic—that is, the alphabet and punctuation marks from which the formulas of its language are constructed.
