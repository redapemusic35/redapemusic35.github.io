    "text": "The Artisans and the Poets\n\nWhat virtues belong to each class?\nWhat is the first class that Plato discusses?\n\n\nOddly enough, in Bk III, Plato leaves off any discussion of what he calls poetry, because even though he is convinced that poetry disrupts the training of the just sole, he cannot say how it does so until he has defined justice. This part of the project takes from Bk III to Bk IVX to do. While his conclusion is that art can disrupt this ideal ordering of the tripartite self, it is not until we get to Bk X to see how this is possible.\n\n\nArtists, most notably the poets, are often cited as teachers of virtue. Yet, the most they are capable of is imitation. This brings us to the primary argument in Bk X of the Republic. What is this class of thing which poetry belongs to?"

Historical Precedent\nThe second recognition by Aristotle, is that Poetry has a history.\n\nA part of that history includes literary criticism, and literary history for instance.\nHe views this history in the contexts of other cultural evolutionary markers such as the cultural evolution of tragedy and comedy.\nMimesis, is an approach to art criticism which did not begin with Aristotle."

Establishing Genre Boundaries\nThe third element of this work includes the establishment and employment of genre.\n\nFor Aristotle, genre is a scheme of enquiry that seeks to provide conditions through which mimetic concepts such as media, mimetic objects, and modes are delimited. In other words, he develops:\nConditions for categorizing this class of object\nConcepts that relate to this class of object\nModes of inquiry in which to explore items in this class of object"

They would also have been familiar with Plato’s works such as the Phaedrus and the Symposium for instance.\nFirst difference: Rhythm, language, harmony.\n\nHarmony and rhythm by themselves correlate with flute and lyre playing. But imagine the lyre or flute without harmony or rhythm, e.g., imitative piping. It would seem that here, there is a difference in the object of representation, the object that is being represented. The way in which the object is represented, and the means through which it is represented.\nThere are three different possibilities with respect to imitation."

The plausibility of the premises which are taken as given is questionable.\nThere are no premises—the paper merely restates the thesis. Or, if there are premises, they are much more likely to be false than true.\n\n\n\nSupport\nThe premises clearly support the thesis, and the author is aware of exactly the kind of support they provide. The argument is either valid as it stands, or, if invalid, the thesis, based on the premises, is likely to be or plausibly true.\nThe premises support the thesis, and the author is aware of the general kind of support they provide. The argument is either valid as it stands, or, if invalid, the thesis, based on the premises, is likely to be or plausibly true.\nThe premises somewhat support the thesis, but the author is not aware of the kind of support they provide. The argument is invalid, and the thesis, based on the premises, is not likely to be or plausibly true.\nThe premises do not support the thesis.\n\n\n\nStudent Response\nThe paper considers both obvious and unobvious counter-examples, counter-arguments, and/or opposing positions, and provides original and/or thoughtful responses.\nThe paper considers obvious counter-examples, counter-arguments, and/or opposing positions, and provides responses.\nThe paper may consider some obvious counter-examples, counter-arguments, and/or opposing positions, but some obvious ones are missed. Responses are non-existent or mere claims of refutation.\nNo counter-examples, counter-arguments, or opposing positions are considered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Points: 640 points, distributed as above.\n\nFormula: Raw scores summed across sheets; final percentage = SUM(all assignment points)/640 * 100.\n\nLetter Grade:\nFinal grade uses the following scale (no rounding):\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA+\n97–100%\n\n\nA\n93–96%\n\n\nA-\n90–92%\n\n\nB+\n87–89%\n\n\nB\n83–86%\n\n\nB-\n80–82%\n\n\nC+\n77–79%\n\n\nC\n73–76%\n\n\nC-\n70–72%\n\n\nD+\n67–69%\n\n\nD\n63–66%\n\n\nD-\n60–62%\n\n\nF\n&lt;60%\n\n\n\nExample: Perfect scores = 32 + 160 + 160 + 80 + 80 + 96 + 32 = 640 points (100%, A+).\n\n\n\n\n\n📍 Lecture\nSee Class Times Below\n\n\n💻 Class Groups\n\n\n📆 Mondays and Wednesdays\n⌚ 10:30am - 11:45am"

It will then cover predicate logic semantics and inference.\n\n\n\n\n📑 Aesthetics\n Aesthetics, Fall 2025 \n\nThis course will explore enduring questions regarding beauty and, it’s place in art, philosophy and life; we will consider what an encounter with beauty is, we will consider the transformative power of beauty and art. We will ask about the relationships between art, art criticism, excellence in art and the human experience of beauty. We will consider how all of this works in modernity: a world of mass production, museums, commercial appropriation of art, and ubiquitous reproductions of works of art.\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Holmes wears a top hat’",

    "text": "Let’s identify the main components of this argument\n\nIn Bernard Suits’ The Grasshopper and Return of the Grasshopper, game-play is claimed to be the ‘ideal of existence’ and the only activity that could sustain us through the ‘endless and endlessly boring summer’ of utopia. Christopher Yorke has challenged these claims by way of a constructive dilemma. If these games are sufficiently akin to the games we play, then they are not adequate to the task of rendering immortality tolerable. If these games are importantly different than the games we play, then, in being ‘unknown and unknowable’, they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own and, so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration. Against Yorke’s skepticism, I argue that the games that constitute the ideal of existence are intelligible to us because we already play what the Grasshopper calls ‘open games’. Steffen Borge concedes that utopian games are intelligible, but argues that such games would fail to ‘grab our minds and imagination’. In the second half of the paper, I contend, against Borge, that such open games are adequate to the task of sustaining the interest of an immortal community."

Formation rules define what counts as a formula by giving general directions for assembling formulas out of simple symbols, or characters. They are the rules of grammar for a formal language. In order to state the formation rules for propositional logic, we need first to define the character set for propositional logic—that is, the alphabet and punctuation marks from which the formulas of its language are constructed. We stipulate that a character for the language of propositional logic is anything belonging to one of the following four sets:"
