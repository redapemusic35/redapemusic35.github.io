[31]\n\n\nMeaning is a characterization of the meaning of the use of logical operators within a given sentence.\n\nWhat this correlates to, I think, is a question about how a logical operator attirbutes truth or falsehood to a sentence.\nFor instance, in what situations would the sentence “James knows that God exists” be true?\nHow might we imagine various sentences that confirm the truth of P?\n\nOne day, I asked James ‘do you know who God is?’ He said yes and then pointed down at a rock. I then asked James ‘does God exist?’ Again he pointed down at the rock and said yes, ‘God exists’.\n\nIs the sentence ‘James knows God exists’, true in this situation?\nIn otherwords, the meaning of a term is its ‘truth conditions’\nWhat are truth conditions? The meaning of a term. Conditions on which a proposition is true or false.\n\nThe truth conditions for a term are rules which specify the possible situations in which sentences containing that term are true and the possible situations in which sentences containing that term are false.\n\n\nIn this section, we will give the truth-conditional semantics for the five logical operators introduced in the previous section."

    "text": "Semantics\n\nSemantics is the Study of Meaning\n\n\n\nHow do you define meaning?\nHow does the book define meaning?\n\n\nThe logical meaning of an expression is usually understood as its contribution to the truth or falsity of sentences in which it occurs. [31]\n\n\nMeaning is a characterization of the meaning of the use of logical operators within a given sentence.\n\nWhat this correlates to, I think, is a question about how a logical operator attirbutes truth or falsehood to a sentence.\nFor instance, in what situations would the sentence “James knows that God exists” be true?\nHow might we imagine various sentences that confirm the truth of P?\n\nOne day, I asked James ‘do you know who God is?’ He said yes and then pointed down at a rock. I then asked James ‘does God exist?’ Again he pointed down at the rock and said yes, ‘God exists’.\n\nIs the sentence ‘James knows God exists’, true in this situation?\nIn otherwords, the meaning of a term is its ‘truth conditions’\nWhat are truth conditions? The meaning of a term. Conditions on which a proposition is true or false.\n\nThe truth conditions for a term are rules which specify the possible situations in which sentences containing that term are true and the possible situations in which sentences containing that term are false.\n\n\nIn this section, we will give the truth-conditional semantics for the five logical operators introduced in the previous section."
