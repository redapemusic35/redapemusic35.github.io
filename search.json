    "text": "The Artisans and the Poets\n\nWhat virtues belong to each class?\nWhat is the first class that Plato discusses?\n\n\nOddly enough, in Bk III, Plato leaves off any discussion of what he calls poetry, because even though he is convinced that poetry disrupts the training of the just sole, he cannot say how it does so until he has defined justice. This part of the project takes from Bk III to Bk IVX to do. While his conclusion is that art can disrupt this ideal ordering of the tripartite self, it is not until we get to Bk X to see how this is possible.\n\n\nArtists, most notably the poets, are often cited as teachers of virtue. Yet, the most they are capable of is imitation. This brings us to the primary argument in Bk X of the Republic. What is this class of thing which poetry belongs to?"

    "section": "De Musica",
    "text": "De Musica\n\nWe must not hate what is below us, but rather with God’s help put it in its right place, setting in right order what is below us, ourselves, and what is above us, and not being offended by the lower, but delighting only in the higher.\n\n\nDe Musica is one of Augustine’s lesser known treatises. More central to scholarly focus on his writings, are typically his theological claims, epistemology, what can be known and how, and his philosophy of mind, his theses of concepualizing the difference between soul and body. However, De Musica provides a unique insight into Augustine’s reflections on the role of music in his own conversion and other spiritual experiences. He begines with what might be called a commandment, or psychological admonition.\n\n\n\nPerception of the beautiful\nand its constrast against perception of evil\nHow to do it?\n\n\nThis is an important claim. Consider two kinds of non-profit organizations. One is defined by all the things it is against, e.g., anti-war, anti-poverty, anti-racism, etc. The other defines itself by all the things that it is for, to promote peace, love, unity, etc.\nBut from his claims about perception, are those about what improves perception in such a way that it contributes to memory. Namely, we have first two kinds of event. Augustine admonishes us to focus on beautiful events and not ugly ones. But what are some practical ways in which we can focus on the one and not the other? While perception through experience enables one kind of reflection, there are other kinds of reflection that we are capable of, even if we have not had the experience.\nAlso as important, one aspect of what enables the right kind and object of perception, has to do with reflection. Is reflection merely a kind of perception where there is some object that once was external but now is internalized? For instance, consider what his says about the differences between his knowledge of his father and grandfather.\n\n\n\n\nI think differently about my father whom I have seen and about my grandfather whom I have never seen. My thought of my father comes from memory, but my thought of my grandfather comes from mental movements arising out of other mental movements which are contained in memory.\n\n\n\nWhen considering what kinds of reflections we are capable of, the next question is how do we improve our ability to reflect on the beautiful and not the ugly? For Augustine, this is the place of music and why God has given us the capacity for music. But in order to understand why music, we have to first think about what music is.\n\n\n\nOur rhythmic or metric art, which is used by makers of verses, comprises certain rhythmical measurements according to which they make the verses.\n\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement of wave, distance traveled over period of time\n\n\n\nFor Augustine, there is an important relationship between random sounds, and time. What is the difference between a musical note, say ‘A’ as produced by the strike of a hammer on a piano string, and a child striking a mallet on a taut piece of wire? It helps to understand something about the metaphysics of music here. For instance, we might know that what we experience as sound, is a collection of vibrations either through the air, or another medium such as a piece of wood or metal. We typically measure these vibrations in the form of Hertz. The measurement, if I am not mistaken, is taken in a similar fashion to how we measure other waves such as radio, ocean, etc. I will not begin to make any further claims about the physics of sound, except to draw attention to rhythm as a measurement of time, and music as a measurement of sound in relationship to time. Therefore, if we hit a medium such as a piano string with a mallet or hammer, and it so happens to be taut enough such that upon being hit, it will vibrate in such a way that it produces a succession of waves that can be measured at 440 Hz, meaning 440 waves per whatever unit of time is selected as standard, then we will hear the note ‘A’.\n\n\nAdditionally, what we experience as different sounds, are the different frequencies at which these vibrations occur. In western music, most instruments are tuned to a standard frequency of 440 Hz.",

Most notably, he is known for both his City of God, (De Civite Dei) and his Confessions, (Augustini Confessiones). Famously, Augustine’s mother, Saint Monica, was a devout Christian while his father was a Roman official.

Being a Roman official in 354 CE, also meant that his father was a pagan a fact often reflected on with some expressions of regret by Augustine in his Confessions especailly.\nAugustine is often known for his reflections on his youth and his conversion to Christianity. More importantly, much of his mature and independent philosophical work (not necessitated by duties of his office for instance) focuses on his theological reflections and philosophical claims regarding his ability to know about abstract concepts such as God, the soul, and the afterlife."

More central to scholarly focus on his writings, are typically his theological claims, epistemology, what can be known and how, and his philosophy of mind, his theses of concepualizing the difference between soul and body. However, De Musica provides a unique insight into Augustine’s reflections on the role of music in his own conversion and other spiritual experiences. He begines with what might be called a commandment, or psychological admonition."

The plausibility of the premises which are taken as given is questionable.\nThere are no premises—the paper merely restates the thesis. Or, if there are premises, they are much more likely to be false than true.\n\n\n\nSupport\nThe premises clearly support the thesis, and the author is aware of exactly the kind of support they provide.

The argument is either valid as it stands, or, if invalid, the thesis, based on the premises, is likely to be or plausibly true.\nThe premises somewhat support the thesis, but the author is not aware of the kind of support they provide. The argument is invalid, and the thesis, based on the premises, is not likely to be or plausibly true.\nThe premises do not support the thesis.\n\n\n\nStudent Response\nThe paper considers both obvious and unobvious counter-examples, counter-arguments, and/or opposing positions, and provides original and/or thoughtful responses.\nThe paper considers obvious counter-examples, counter-arguments, and/or opposing positions, and provides responses.\nThe paper may consider some obvious counter-examples, counter-arguments, and/or opposing positions, but some obvious ones are missed.

It will then cover predicate logic semantics and inference.\n\n\n\n\n📑 Aesthetics\n Aesthetics, Fall 2025 \n\nThis course will explore enduring questions regarding beauty and, it’s place in art, philosophy and life; we will consider what an encounter with beauty is, we will consider the transformative power of beauty and art. We will ask about the relationships between art, art criticism, excellence in art and the human experience of beauty. We will consider how all of this works in modernity: a world of mass production, museums, commercial appropriation of art, and ubiquitous reproductions of works of art.\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Holmes wears a top hat’",

I then asked James ‘does God exist?’ Again he pointed down at the rock and said yes, ‘God exists’.\n\nIs the sentence ‘James knows God exists’, true in this situation?\nIn otherwords, the meaning of a term is its ‘truth conditions’\nWhat are truth conditions?

    "text": "Let’s identify the main components of this argument\n\nIn Bernard Suits’ The Grasshopper and Return of the Grasshopper, game-play is claimed to be the ‘ideal of existence’ and the only activity that could sustain us through the ‘endless and endlessly boring summer’ of utopia. Christopher Yorke has challenged these claims by way of a constructive dilemma. If these games are sufficiently akin to the games we play, then they are not adequate to the task of rendering immortality tolerable. If these games are importantly different than the games we play, then, in being ‘unknown and unknowable’, they would characterize a form of life that is importantly different from our own and, so, would be inappropriate objects of social and political aspiration. Against Yorke’s skepticism, I argue that the games that constitute the ideal of existence are intelligible to us because we already play what the Grasshopper calls ‘open games’. Steffen Borge concedes that utopian games are intelligible, but argues that such games would fail to ‘grab our minds and imagination’. In the second half of the paper, I contend, against Borge, that such open games are adequate to the task of sustaining the interest of an immortal community."

In order to state the formation rules for propositional logic, we need first to define the character set for propositional logic—that is, the alphabet and punctuation marks from which the formulas of its language are constructed.

Establishing Genre Boundaries\nThe third element of this work includes the establishment and employment of genre.\n\nFor Aristotle, genre is a scheme of enquiry that seeks to provide conditions through which mimetic concepts such as media, mimetic objects, and modes are delimited. In other words, he develops:\nConditions for categorizing this class of object\nConcepts that relate to this class of object\nModes of inquiry in which to explore items in this class of object\n\n\n\nasserts the significance of formal design and unity for both the composition and the appreciation of literary works, and to offer a conception of artistic form which relates it to the organic forms crucial to his understanding of nature. [(hall95?), 10; 50b34-51a6]\n\n\n\nAlthough we might call this approach ‘formalist’, a question arises about the necessity of genre concepts inferred in a particular mimetic example.\n\nFor instance, he references Plato’s analysis of mimetic modes in Ch. III of this work.\nHowever, for Aristotle, mimesis is an attempt to understand the broader world, by reference to the human propensity to represent human experiences through fictive representation, and imaginative reenactment.\nIn this way, Aristotle likely hopes to connect art to human nature as a capacity for human desire to understand universal concepts whether moral, religious, ethical, or relational.",

Being a Roman official in 354 CE, also meant that his father was a pagan a fact often reflected on with some expressions of regret by Augustine in his Confessions especailly.\nAugustine is often known for his reflections on his youth and his conversion to Christianity. More importantly, much of his mature and independent philosophical work (not necessitated by duties of his office for instance) focuses on his theological reflections and philosophical claims regarding his ability to know about abstract concepts such as God, the soul, and the afterlife."

More central to scholarly focus on his writings, are typically his theological claims, epistemology, what can be known and how, and his philosophy of mind, his theses of concepualizing the difference between soul and body. However, De Musica provides a unique insight into Augustine’s reflections on the role of music in his own conversion and other spiritual experiences.
