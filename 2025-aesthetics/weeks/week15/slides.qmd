# What is Aesthetics?

* Realm of the Beautiful
* Art more generally
* Fine Art more particularly

::: {.notes}

Science of sensation of feeling

In Germany, "works of art being considered in light of the feelings which they were supposed to evoke."

* Pleasure
* Admiration
* Fear
* Pity

What is wrong with this characterization?

* Does not treat beauty more generally, but only artistic beauty.

* What is Aesthetic then?

The philosophy (love of wisdom) of Fine Art

* So we might call this "the wisdom of Fine Art".

But what is this wisdom?

:::

## Reason and Judgment

* Cultural
* Social
* Technological changes in 20th century

::: {.notes}

There were many cultural, social and technological changes in the 20th century that influenced how art was made and perceived.

For instance, consider the rise of abstract art, conceptual art, and digital art.

* Impressionism
* Abstract Painting
* Photography

# Reading Chapter 1

* What is aesthetic?

* What kind of discipline is it?

* What are its questions? Methods?

::: {.notes}

Science of sensation or feeling but why?

:::

---

* Does not treat beauty in general, only artistic.

* What is general? What is artistic?

## The Philosophy of Art

* Excludes questions about beauty of nature, beauty more generally.

* Beauty of art then?

::: {.notes}

* Artistic beauty stands higher than natural because of its connection to the mind.

* Why? Can only mind perceive truth? As such, there is no truth in nature.

> Mind, and mind only, is capable of truth, and comprehends in itself all that is, so that whatever is beautiful can only be really and truly beautiful as partaking in this higher element and as created thereby. [218]

:::

---

Therefore:

> beauty of nature reveals itself as but a reflection of the beauty which belongs to the mind, as an imperfect, incomplete mode of being ... whose substantial element is contained in the mind itself. [218]

---

### What is the science of beauty then?

First consider whether art is:

1. A necessity, practical (for morality and piety)
2. Or only a luxury (entertainment)

* One is a kind of reason
* The other sensuality

::: {.notes}

What is wrong with this characterization?

> nothing is gained for reason and duty by the attempt at mediation, because these principles, as essentially incapable of intermixture, can be parties to no such compromise, but demand in their manifestation the same purity which they have in themselves. [219]

:::

---

### Art as Necessity or Luxury

* It seems that at best, it is pleasing amusement only

But,

::: {.r-fit-all}

> The beauty of art presents itself to sense, to feeling, to perception, to imagination; its sphere is not that of thought, and the apprehension of its activity and its productions demand another organ than that of the scientific intelligence. [219]

---

#### The beauty of art lies in truth, which is different from pleasing amusement

---

and so,

> the organ of artistic activity and enjoymnet --- is of necessity excluded from science. . . . seeing that art is what cheers and animates the dull and withered dryness of the idea, reconciles with reality its abstraction and its dissociation therefrom, and supplies out of the real world what is lacking to the notion, . . . [219]
