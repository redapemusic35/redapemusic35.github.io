# Art and its cognitive value

## Reason and Judgment

* Cultural
* Social
* Technological changes in 20th century

1. Critique of Aesthetic Judgment

  * Major points:
    * aesthetic experience and judgments of the beautiful
    * of the sublime
    * and of artistic creation

---

2. Critique of Teleological Judgment

  * appeal to ends
  * purposes
  * or goals (nature and sciences)

1. Faculty or the Power of Judgment

   * universals
   * particulars

::: {.notes}

In the critique of pure reason, Kant discusses how we use our faculty of understanding to form concepts of universals from particulars.

* faculty of understanding is that cognitive faculty that allows us to look at a particular object, and develop a universal category under which all objects of that kind can fall.

* consider classes of objects: all dogs with spots, all tables, all beautiful things

* consider particular objects: this dog with spots, this table, this beautiful thing

> The more distinctive role assigned to judgment in the Critique of Judgment is the reflecting role, that of “finding” the universal for the given particular (Introduction IV, 5:179). [@kant22]

* So the kind of judgment employed with developing universals from particulars is called reflective judgment.

* In the empirical sciences, this judgment is responsible for classifying natural things into genera and species.

* This also applies to our use of imagination

::: {.r-fit-text}

>  In order to decide whether or not something is
beautiful, we do not relate the representation by
means of understanding to the object for
cognition, but rather relate it by means of the
imagination (perhaps combined with the
understanding) to the subject and its feeling of
pleasure or displeasure. [@cahn20, p. 155]

But reflective judgment is also responsible for:

* Aesthetic: the beautiful and the sublime
* Teleological: purpose and function in nature
