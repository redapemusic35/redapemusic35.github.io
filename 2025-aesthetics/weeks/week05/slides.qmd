* Earliest surviving work dedicated to art in the Western canon.

* Rediscovered by sixteenth-century Italian theorists.

  * Notable since other works of Aristotle were discovered first by Islamic philosophers during the early medieval ages.

* Originally written as a set of teaching notes and lecture materials for use in his academy.

* What is he doing in the Poetics and what is his motivation behind it?

* What is Aristotle's response to Plato's various critiques?

  * Religious

  * Moralistic

  * Psychological

  * Political

* First a member of Plato's academy, then founded his own: the Lyceum (335-23)

* The Peotics reflect a comprehensive, systematic, and analytic attempt to scrutinize in what would come to be known, Aristotelian, manner [Hallifex, 6].

* This manner begins with a definition of key terms, a large number of cross references which seek to make connections between the various tenets found in his texts.

* According to Steven hallifex, there are three essential elements to understanding Greek poetry.

  1. Defining poetry as a general category of representational arts, or mimesis. This category includes visual arts, poetry, music, and dancing.

  2. The second recognition by Aristotle, is that Poetry has a history.
    * A part of that history includes literary criticism, and literary history for instance.
    * He views this history in the contexts of other cultural evolutionary markers such as the cultural evolution of tragedy and comedy.

* Mimesis, is an approach to art criticism which did not begin with Aristotle.

3. The third element of this work includes the establishment and employment of genre.

  * For Aristotle, genre is a scheme of enquiry that seeks to provide conditions through which mimetic concepts such as media, mimetic objects, and modes are delimited. In other words, he:

> asserts the significance of formal design and unity for both the composition and the appreciation of literary works, and to offer a conception of artistic form which relates it to the organic forms crucial to his understanding of nature. [@hall95, 10; 50b34-51a6]

* Although we might call this approach 'formalist', a question arises about the necessity of genre concepts inferred in a particular mimetic example.

  * For instance, he references Plato's analysis of mimetic modes in Ch. III of this work.

  * However, for Aristotle, mimesis is an attempt to understand the broader world, by reference to the human propensity to represent human experiences fictive representation, and imaginative reinactment.

  * In this way, Aristotle likely hopes to connect art to human nature as a capacity for human desire to understand universal concepts whether moral, religious, ethical, or relational.
