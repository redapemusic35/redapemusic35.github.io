Perhaps one of the best examples of the use of the Ionian mode:

Tuesday's Gone by Lynard Skynard:

## Dorian Mode:

> Just leave me the mode that would suitably imitate the tone and rhythm of a courageious person who is active in battle or doing other violent deeds, or who is failing and facing wounds, death, or some other misfortune, and who, in all these circumstances, is fighting off his fate steadily and with self-control.

---

Leave me also another mode, that of someone engaged in a peaceful, unforced, voluntary action, persuading someone or asking a favor of a god in prayer or of a human being through teaching and exhortation, or, on the other hand, of someone submitting to the supplications of another who is teaching him and trying to get him to change his mind, and who, in all these circumstances, is acting in moderation and self-control, not with arrogance but with understanding, and is content with the outcome.

## A favorite artist of mine,

Glad to see Plato would approve:
