## Course Schedule

* Each chapter has exercises.
* Although these are not all graded, I highly recommend you do at least a few of each.
* The one's that are required need to be turned in by the night before the second class meeting of that week.
* This will give me the weekend to grade and return feedback the following class meeting.
* If you have trouble with any of the assignments, whether required or recommended, bring them to office hours either mine or the Grey's.

## Advice

* Mastering the material takes practice.
* You *must* do the problems yourself.
* Watching someone else do something is not the same as doing it yourself.
* Keep up with the assignment schedule.
* Cramming will not be a helpful way to prepare for the exams in this course.

# Early Logics

A deduction is speech (logos) in which, certain things having been supposed, something different from those supposed results of necessity because of their being so. (Prior Analytics I.2, 24b18‚Äì20)

# Some Early Logic Manuals

* Categories
* On Interpretation
* Prior Analytics
* Posterior Analytics
* Topics
* On Sophistical Refutations

## The Elimination of Metaphysics

> The traditional disputes of philosophers are, for the most part, as unwar-
ranted as they are unfruitful. The surest way to end them is to establish
beyond question what should be the purpose and method of a philosophical
inquiry. And this is by no means so difficult a task as the history of philoso-
phy would lead one to suppose. For if there are any questions which science
leaves it to philosophy to answer, a straightforward process of elimination
must lead to their discovery. [Alfred Jules Ayer, *Language, Truth, and Logic*]

## What Makes a Sentence Meaningful?

::: {.incremental}

Consider:

- > ‚Äòthe Absolute enters into, but is itself incapable of, evolution and progress‚Äô,

- or one cannot conceive of an observation which would enable one to determine whether the Absolute did, or did not, enter into evolution and progress.

:::

## Criterion of Verifiability

::: {.incremental}
* A sentence is meaningful when it is factually significant.
* In order to determine whether a sentence is facutally significant?
* It must be empirically verifiable
:::

# What's the point?! What is Logic!? {.bigger}

* We know what makes a sentence meaningful.
* Book says logic is the study of reason.
* Words are the language of thought.

## What is a good thought?

> We need only formulate the criterion which enables us to test whether a sentence expresses a genuine proposition about a matter of fact, and then point out that the sentences under consideration fail to satisfy it. [Criterion of Verifiability]

## Ayer's Attempt

> We say that a sentence is factually
significant to any given person, if, and only if, he knows how to verify the
proposition which it purports to express‚Äîthat is, if he knows what observations would lead him, under certain conditions, to accept the proposition
as being true, or reject it as being false.

## What is a proposition?

## Some Possibilities

::: {.incremental}
* Sentences
* Words
* Indicatives
* Imperatives
* Declarative Statements
:::

## A statement that is true or false

* Ways to determine whether a statement is true or false.

::: {.incremental}
* Understand the historical meaning.
* See the truth of what it purports with your own eyes.
* Perhaps trust the testimonial source.
* ?
:::

## But can you *empirically* prove the original moon landing?

::: {.incremental}
* Or that every single bird you see is not a mechanical robot?
* That the earth is not flat?
* Yes you can.
:::

## Through Argument

* Sequence of declarative sentences
* Some are premises
* One is a conclusion
* Both premises and conclusions are propositions

## All women are mortal

::: {.incremental}
* Can this be verified?
* Can ***we*** verify it?
:::

---

::: {.incremental}
-< All women are mortal
-< I am a woman
-< I am mortal

### Is this a good argument? Why?

Is it a good argument if I am the speaker?

## There are two ways to evaluate an argument

* Is it valid?
* Is it sound?

## Sound or not?

> To prove in the fullest sense means (at least) to have a sound
argument‚Äîto reason validly from true premises.

## Syncategorematic terms


1. All courses numbered less than 400 are undergraduate courses.

2. No undergraduate course can be taken for graduate credit.

$\therefore$

3. No course numbered less than 400 can be taken for graduate credit.

---

> In other words, every idea in a conclusion must "come from" somewhere, i.e., from one or
more of the premises.  Conclusions should be "summations" of the premises. ... The fundamental ideas in the conclusion are "course numbered less than 400" and "being taken for
graduate credit".  The first of these ideas comes from the first premise and the second from the
second.  Each has its origin in a premise, and this accounts, at least in part, for the conclusion's
relevance.

# 1.5 Use and Mention

The following sentence is true:

* 'Smog' is a four-letter word.

But this is false:

Which king? And why would he want to do that? But, of course, what is intended is:

* 'The King' refers to Elvis.
