title: "🗓️ Week 08 - Bonaventure"
---

Saint Bonaventure was born in 1221 and he died on July 15 1274 (53 years old). He was a Fransiscan and was a master of theology and philosophy having studied theology at the University of Paris. He was also a *Minister General*, some kind of *high ranking official*. He is best known for his *The Journey of the Mind into God*.

As the following quote shows, Bonaventure was not only committed to theology, but philosophy which according to him, was a method of better understanding the beliefs he held. It is important to note that this practice was important even for what he considered matters of faith, suppositions held when the facts supporting those are not fully grasped.

> And so, if the writings of the philosophers are sometimes of much value in understanding truth and refuting errors, we are not departing from the purity of faith if we at times study them, especially since there are many questions of faith which cannot be settled without recourse to them. (trans. Monti 1994: 53)
