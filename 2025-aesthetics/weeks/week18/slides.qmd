# Essentialist Definitions

## Some Attempts to Define Art

* Representation or mimesis
* Mirror of Reality
* Functionalism
* Institutional
* Historical
* Cluster or Family Resemblance

> Though a large proportion of artworks do involve representation, it quickly becomes clear that this definition is prone to examples of artworks that do not-pure orchestral music and some abstract art, for example-and objects such as billboard advertisements that do involve representation but which are nevertheless not artworks. [@tavi09, 16]

Consider the project of philosophy to create definitions for complex phenomena. At the center of this project is first being able to articulate what specifically this project is, namely what is a defnition and what purposes does it serve?

What makes this account true?

Such an account is true just in case there are properties whose instantiation by an object counts as a matter of conceeptual necessity toward its falling under the concept. [@cahn20, 462]

> Such definitions attempt to explain, clarify, or even revise the conceptual status of a term in common usage and come in the form of a condition or set of conditions that are necessary and sufficient for *x* to be *y*. [@tavi09, 15]


::: {.notes}

Tavinor refers to these as "necessary and sufficient conditions".

Water is defined as H20 becassue water must possess two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom to be water, and anything that possesses these atoms is water.
