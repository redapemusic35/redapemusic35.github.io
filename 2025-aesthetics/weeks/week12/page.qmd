title: "🗓️ Week 12 - David Hume"

Consider where praise and blame is applied. We praise others for their actions if we agree with those actions. We blame them if we disagree with their actions. Where does the praise and blame come from? They come from our emotions that are evoked in response to those actions. Where else do we find praise and blame appropriate? One way to know, is to look at when we have similar emotions. We have similar emotions as responses to art.
