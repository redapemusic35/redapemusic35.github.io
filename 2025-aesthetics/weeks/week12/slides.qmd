# Natural beauty vs human ordered design

* Consider the difference between Garden vs. forest?

* What is it? (Unity of design)

* Three degrees of beauty

## 1. Natural

These have no forming action, intelligence, or power (presumably to create?)

## 2. Design

Is an effect of some cognitive process. He calls this double beauty, but why? a) it is an effect of the mind, and b) the mind itself. What does it mean to say of the mind itself?

---

* Force of love? Power of enjoyment (can animals enjoy what is beautiful?)

* Several kinds of virtues
  * The power of enjoyment
  * The power to create what is beautiful

---

> Therefore whatever beauty appears in our second order of forms, or whatever is derived or produced from thence, all this is eminently, principally, and originally in this last order of supreme and sovereign beauty. [99]

## 3. Beauty that creates more beauty

Why is this third degree important? 

1. We are notable designers and creators of what is beautiful.

2. These objects contain all the beauty that exists in our minds. (Sense our sense and ability to enjoy is a part of the power that manifests in our ability to create beauty).

3. Therefore what is produced contains all this other beauty.

4. Therefore we are original beauty (natural)

# What is the Sublime?

* First, what is mere figure?

## Symmetrical vs non-uniform

* What about actions?

::: {.notes}

Natural beauty in figures and in actions. For instance, an action that includes grace and harmony. We can focus on those actions that cause strong sentiments. What kinds of sentiments do these actions, figures, cause?

There is agreement in judgment of actions, but not beauty.

> But now we found perpetual variance among mankind, whose differences were chiefly founded on this disagreement in opinion; “The one affirming, the other denying that this, or that, was fit or decent.”

* Beautiful action

* Beautiful figure

---

But we typically call beautiful actions *good*, but we do not say this about figures.

> We seek the right and wrong in things; we examine what is honourable, what shameful; and having at last determined, we dare not stand to our own judgment, and are ashamed to own there is really a shameful and an honourable.

## But is this an objection?

> All is opinion. ’Tis opinion which makes beauty, and unmakes it. The graceful or
ungraceful in things, the decorum arid its contrary, the amiable and unamiable, vice, virtue, honour, shame, all this is founded in opinion only.

---

* But what about shame and regret? Does these sentiments exist in response to art or only actions?

* Is beauty the same cause of both negative sentiment, disgust for instance, and positive ones, say satisfaction or admiration?

No, it seems that beauty exists in the eye of the beholder:

> And if we have not idly spent our hours, nor ranged in vain through these deserted regions, it should appear from our strict search that there is nothing so divine as beauty, which belonging not to body, nor having any principle or existence except in mind and reason, is alone discovered and acquired by this diviner part, when it inspects itself, the only object worthy of itself. [103]

---

Or in the eye of the creator:

> And if we have not idly spent our hours, nor ranged in vain through these deserted regions, it should appear from our strict search that there is nothing so divine as beauty, which belonging not to body, nor having any principle or existence except in mind and reason, is alone discovered and acquired by this diviner part, when it inspects itself, the only object worthy of itself. [103]
