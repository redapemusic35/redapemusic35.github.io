# Approbation and Blame

> As this variety of taste is obvious to the most
careless enquirer; so will it be found, on examina-
tion, to be still greater in reality than in appear-
ance. The sentiments of men often differ with
regard to beauty and deformity of all kinds, even
while their general discourse is the same. There
are certain terms in every language, which import
blame, and others praise; and all men, who use
the same tongue, must agree in their application of them.
