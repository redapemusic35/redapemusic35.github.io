# Imagination and the judgment of beauty

1. What is an aesthetic judgment?
2. What is a cognitive judgment?

Consider:

1. Understanding and Cognition
2. Pleasure and Imagination
3. 2 aligns with taste and judgments of taste are aesthetic.

Why? Two Concepts:

## The Quality of Beauty in two arguments

## First

> ***Taste*** is the faculty of judging an object or kind or representation through a satisfaction or dissatisfaction **without any interest**. The object of such a satisfaction is called beautiful. [159]

---

1. Analytic of the Beautiful 
2. Definition of the Beautiful
3. Universal beauty which is not conceptual
4. Beauty and the representation of purpose (conceptual)
5. Satisfying Objects

## Second

> That is beautiful which pleases universally without a concept. [164]

---

6. Beauty is conceptless and universal.
7. Concepts, personal, universal
   * The beautiful 
   * the agreeable (subjective aesthetic judgment)
   * the good.

---

| | Subjective | Objective |
|---|---|---|
| conceptual | agreeable | good |
| conceptless | | beauty |

---

8. Universal Aesthetic Judgments?

When ascribing a judgment, the assumption is that everyone will be satisfied with the judgment.

1. Beauty is objective.
2. Judgments of beauty should be objective.

## The Sublime

1. Judgments based on reflection
2. Quantify, quality, and modality
3. Perceptions and Conceptions
4. Normativity and Judgments of taste
5. Common human understanding (sensus communis)
6. Intellect and Beauty

---

7. Art
8. Art and Beauty
9. Art and nature
10. Artistic Talent
11. The nature of artistic talent
12. Judging someone to be artistically talented

## Analytic of the Beautiful

> But if the question is whether something is beautiful, one does not want to know whether there is anything that is, or that could be at stake for us, or for someone else, in the existence of the thing, but rather how we judge it in the mere contemplation (intuition or reflection). [156]

---

Judging that something is beautiful is objective.

1. Judgment of Taste
2. Non-subjective judgments
3. Subjective judgments
4. Judgments of *good* are combined self-interested, subjective
5. Three kinds of satisfaction

---

# But what are judgments of taste?

| Objective | Subjective |
|---|---|
| Cognition| Imagination |

---

### Objects and their representations

The table in the restaurant is an object, but the table in the art museum is a representation of a object.

Therefore 2 kinds of representation:

> we do not relate the representation by means of Understanding to the object for cognition, but relate it by means of the imagination (perhaps combined with the understanding) to the subject and its feeling of pleasure or displeasure.

---

1. Representation of objective sensations? Those which signify what is real in an empirical representation.
2. Representation that is related to the feeling of pleasure or displeasure. Concerns only how the subject is affected by the representation.
3. So two kinds of sensation (which we will revisit later)

---

As such, cognitive judgments seek to judge how things are whereas aesthetic judgments focus on how things appear to us.

* But do we judge how things appear to others?
* How things appear to us individually
* How things appear to us collectively

---

Briefly, what about the person who takes subjective pleasure in risque entertainment? Or who doesn't like others because of their skin color?

* We can apply cognitive judgments: "My neighbor holds false (racist) beliefs"
* But what about aesthetic: My neighbor does not like rap music (or T Swift)

## Or do we only focus on how things make us feel?

1. The road ahead appears to me as though it has water pooled onto its surface. 
2. However this says nothing about how the mirage makes me feel.
3. Do I approve or disapprove of the fact that there appears to be water on the road surface ahead?
4. Do i approve or disapprove of the fact that TSwift's music is unappealing to me?

# Judgment of Taste and Interest

> The satisfaction that we combine with the representation of the existence of an object is called interest.

## Judgment of Taste without Interest

What is interest? Are we made 'satisfied' by the representation of some given object?

---

### Consider Desire

Do we use desire to determine whether some representation satisfies us?

> Hence such a satisfaction always has at the same time a relation to the faculty of desire, either as its determining ground or else as necessarily connected with its determining ground. [155]

Why or why not?

---

Pure vs. Impure judgments of taste.

* What is a pure judgment of taste?

* What is an impure one?

::: {.notes}
Probably those which either are or are not tainted by our desires and interests.
:::

## A slight complication:

* Therefore we must separate our desire for the object
* From our sentiments regarding that object.

---

> One only wants to know whether the mere representation of the object is accompanied with satisfaction in me, however indifferent I might be with regard to the existence of the object of this representation. [156]

---

> Therefore, we must not be biased in favor of the existence of the thing

# But is this possible?

---

## Sensory Pleasure

* Is it pleasurable?
* Agreeable?
* Or both?

> Now here there is an immediate opportunity to reprove and draw attention to a quite common confusion of the double meaning that the word "sensation" can have. [156]

## What is agreeable?

> Everything that pleases, just because it pleases, is agreeable . . ..

What draws our interest . . ..

## The Good as Satisfaction

* Extrinsic: Good for something else
* Intrinsic: Good in itself

## Three different kinds of satisfaction

1. Pathologically conditioned
2. Purely practical
3. Normative

# This account of beauty is normative {.center .middle}
