# The Thingly Nature of Art

![A Stop sign against the backdrop of the California coast](../../../figures/aesthetics-course/stop-sign-along-country-road_Getty-680x402.jpg)

::: {.notes}

Some objects are things.

When looking at objects that are things, we can play a fun game with ourselves: art or not?

> Our aim is to arrive at the immediate and full reality of the work of art, for only in this way shall we discover real art also within it. [398]

::: {.notes}

We can begin with understanding what a thing is by focusing on its function, its practical use.

* What is a mere thing?

There are three considerations here:

Practical Use,

Historical Constitution, they establish a sense of history and time giving them cultural significance.

Thereby, they build our world around us.

What is time without its passage?

:::

## Mere Things

* A block of granite for instance

* A stop sign? Is this a mere thing? No.

::: {.notes}

A stop sign is practically useful.

# What is Artistic Achievement?

::: {.notes}

* When does a work succeed as art?

* and correspondingly, when does it fail?

* By understanding this, when does a game succeed as a game? But more importantly, when does it become art?

## What is Artistic Sophistication?

::: {.notes}

Is it a form of artistic achievement?

Is it merely an accounting of the increasingly technological sophistication of modern games?

> Map Beta is three-dimensional. Stars are shown as colored dots - the shades of which can be changed to represent different sorts of data:

* security status,
* services,
* sovereignty,
* number of pilots in space

> and many others. Lines show the jump gate connections between stars, with the path from your current location to the selected system shown as a dotted line.

::: {.notes}

What is important here is the quantification of data. Each pixel is embueded with large quantifies of information that have significance and represent meaning beyond the game itself.

Each aspect of data here represents not only an artifact created by a game developer, but those artifacts that are created by the players themselves.

For each ship to exist in this game, there first needs to be material mined from asteroids, then refined. The refined materials are then made into base components like different kinds of metal.

::: {.r-fit-text}

> In the EVE universe, the vast majority of items are manufactured by player characters and traded in a relatively free way in the marketplace. Students of economics will note that these markets are neither perfect nor efficient in the technical senses; volumes of many items are low enough that the market can be (and is) manipulated, and the supply of materials and modules is partly provided by loot drops in missions, which can be adjusted without warning by the game developers. Similarly, the developers may adjust the requirements for a manufacturing process, or increase the availability of ore, or otherwise mess in the sandbox.

> Nonetheless, manufacturing and selling items can provide interest and ISK profit for the careful and canny player. The player must be aware, however, that there are plenty of items that destroy value - that is, there are a great number of Tech 1 items, modules especially, that are worth less than the cost of manufacture. Many more items can be sold at a profit, but only in a limited volume in certain markets. Manufacture in these cases may simply be an alternative to hauling stuff between markets.

## Artistic Representation, Injustice, and Exploitation

> But because of the interactive nature of videogame fictions – the player takes a part in the moral situations presented there, and whether or not the evil occurs is often up to them – the potential of games for the exploration of moral issues seems somehow more vivid: and perhaps more dangerous, where the game does not provide opportunities to put the content in a thoughtful or realistic context.

::: {.notes}

But what happens when developers imbibe there creations with data, and create meaning that we would normally otherwise find reprehensible.

For instance, while it is typically obvious that violence is wrong, what is equally worrisome, are the depictions of women and other minorities that we see in GTA San Andreas.

> Here one's emotional response to some object (an event, person, state of affairs, etc) can properly be held to such evaluations as that it is misdirected, unjustified, abnormal, or somehow an emotion one ought not to have, in general or in the particular case.

::: {.notes}

Therefore, is it possible to enjoy fictions like those found in GTA. We might think not since our enjoyment of them would represent a conflict in interests.

We believe that murder is wrong, that people should not be treated as means to an end, but as an end in themselves etc.

##  Gilmore rejects this arguing that

> imaginative activity has an epistemic or practical role like that of beliefs and perceptions, where the function is to aid in, e.g., planning for the future, or discovering some truth about the actual world, our evaluative commitments, or what is metaphysically possible. [@gilm20, 132]
