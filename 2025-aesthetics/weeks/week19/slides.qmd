# Fiction

Fictional qualities can include things like:

* physics
* abilities
* skills
* equipment

::: {.notes}

But does it include things like obligations, responsibilities, and moral duties?

What about tax obligatons? If I own a virtual item in Star Citizen, am I obligated to pay taxes on it?

What about financial transactions involving virtual currency? Are these fictional or real?

What about large scale economic activities within a game's virtual economy, or conflicts?

Are the conflicts in a game virtual, fictional, or actual?

## The fiction of Video Games

* Depict a given world
* Events occur in this world and
* Characters act in this world

::: {.notes}

But do players act in fictional worlds or do only characters act?

Consider subject, predicate, and object relationships among words in a sentence.

::: {.notes}

The obvious attempt is to express a given meaning, and we do this through language.

What is the intended purpose of the expression however?

>  It is not the media or tational form – in both cases, written biography – that makes one fiction and the other non-fiction, because they share a representational form; rather,it is a fact about their intended function that distinguishes them, a fact which surely has to do with what the author had in mind when writing the text: the fictional work is written to be used as a prop for the imagination. [@tavi09, 38]

> When we think about the imagination, examples like the following naturally come to mind: Fred finds himself, in a an idle moment, along with his thoughts. Feeling unsuccessful an dunappreciated, he embarks on a daydream in which he is rich and famous. [@walt90, 13]

::: {.notes}

Both are reasons to imagine

1. Spontaneous and Deligberate Imaginings
2. Occurrent and Nonoccurrent Imaginings
3. Solitary and Social Imaginings
4. Imagining and Entertaining
