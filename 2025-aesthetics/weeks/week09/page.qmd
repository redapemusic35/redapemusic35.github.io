title: "🗓️ Week 09 - Aquinas"
---

Saint Thomas Aquinas is often referred to as "Aristotle baptised". Much of his inspiration comes from the Greek philosopher. Each time that you read "the philosopher" in the Summa, substitute it with Aristotle. For instance, in objection 3 or Article five of Question 5, Aquinas says:

> Further, happiness is a 'perfect operation' according to the philosopher.

Just like 'the philosopher' refers to the person, luckily for us, the work written by the philosopher is cited for us. This reference cites Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*, bk vii, chapter 13. In this chapter, Aristotle defends his view that happiness is *the* Supreme Good. The supreme good means the end of every human activity, the aim of all action is to pursue happiness.

In question 5, Aquinas confront the question about whether happiness can be achieved by us. As you probably know by now, whatever Aquinas' position on a subject is, is first preceded by  three opposing views, and then these are disputed, with an explanation following this dispute followed up by 3 responses to the three opposing views. While this form appears simple, there is a lot of nuance that occurs. Additionally, it would help to know more intimately, the material Aquinas is working against, for instance the *Nicomachean Ethics*.

We've seen other treatises on happiness, for instance it was covered by Augustine.
