## Rubrics

***Weekly Reflections Rubric:*** (Per Reflection, Total 32 Points for 8 Reflections). The rubric is applied holistically to each reflection, with scores contributing to the 32-point total (e.g., per reflection max 4 points, scaled from category scores).

* Grading: Sum of category scores per reflection (max 32 per reflection), but scaled/averaged across 8 reflections to total 32 points for the category. Excel shows example scores of 8 per category per date.

***Reflective Analysis 1 & 2:*** (40, 30, 20, 10 per Category, Total 160 Points)

* Grading: Sum of 4 categories (max 160 points). Excel formula: =SUM(category scores); percentage = (total/160)*100.

***Essay 1 & 2:*** (20, 15, 10, 5 per Category, Total 80 Points)

* Grading: Sum of 4 categories (max 80 points). Excel formula: =SUM(category scores); percentage = (total/80)*100.

***Presentation:*** (24, 18, 12, 6 per Category, Total 96 Points)

* Grading: Sum of 4 categories (max 96 points). Excel formula: =SUM(category scores); percentage = (total/96)*100.

| Category | Excellent | Good | Needs Improvement | Unacceptable |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Thesis | A clear statement of the main conclusion of the paper. | The thesis is obvious, but there is no single clear statement of it. | The thesis is present, but must be uncovered or reconstructed from the text of the paper. | There is no thesis. |
| Premises | Each reason for believing the thesis is made clear, and as much as possible, presented in single statements. It is also clear which premises are to be taken as given, and which will be supported by sub-arguments.  The paper provides sub-arguments for controversial premises. If there are sub-arguments, the premises for these are clear, and made in single statements. The premises which are taken as given are at least plausibly true. | The premises are all clear, although each may not be presented in a single statement. It is also pretty clear which premises are to be taken as given, and which will be supported by sub-arguments. The paper provides sub-arguments for controversial premises. If there are sub-arguments, the premises for these are clear. The premises which are taken as given are at least plausibly true. | The premises must be reconstructed from the text of the paper. It is not made clear which premises are to be taken as given, and which will be supported by sub-arguments. There are no sub-arguments, or, if there are sub-arguments, the premises for these are not made clear. The paper does not provide sub-arguments for controversial premises. The plausibility of the premises which are taken as given is questionable. | There are no premises‚Äîthe paper merely restates the thesis. Or, if there are premises, they are much more likely to be false than true. |
| Support | The premises clearly support the thesis, and the author is aware of exactly the kind of support they provide. The argument is either valid as it stands, or, if invalid, the thesis, based on the premises, is likely to be or plausibly true. | The premises support the thesis, and the author is aware of the general kind of support they provide. The argument is either valid as it stands, or, if invalid, the thesis, based on the premises, is likely to be or plausibly true. | The premises somewhat support the thesis, but the author is not aware of the kind of support they provide. The argument is invalid, and the thesis, based on the premises, is not likely to be or plausibly true. | The premises do not support the thesis. |
| Student Response | The paper considers both obvious and unobvious counter-examples, counter-arguments, and/or opposing positions, and provides original and/or thoughtful responses. | The paper considers obvious counter-examples, counter-arguments, and/or opposing positions, and provides responses. | The paper may consider some obvious counter-examples, counter-arguments, and/or opposing positions, but some obvious ones are missed. Responses are non-existent or mere claims of refutation. | No counter-examples, counter-arguments, or opposing positions are considered. |

## Grading Calculation

Total Points: 640 points, distributed as above.

* Formula: Raw scores summed across sheets; final percentage = SUM(all assignment points)/640 * 100.

***Letter Grade:***

Final grade uses the following scale (no rounding):

| Letter Grade | Percentage |
|---|---|
| A+ | 97‚Äì100% |
| A | 93‚Äì96% |
| A- | 90‚Äì92% |
| B+ | 87‚Äì89% |
| B | 83‚Äì86% |
| B- | 80‚Äì82% |
| C+ | 77‚Äì79% |
| C | 73‚Äì76% |
| C- | 70‚Äì72% |
| D+ | 67‚Äì69% |
| D | 63‚Äì66% |
| D- | 60‚Äì62% |
| F | <60% |

Example: Perfect scores = 32 + 160 + 160 + 80 + 80 + 96 + 32 = 640 points (100%, A+).
