## Sentences {.smaller}

* There are many types of sentences, e.g., imperatives

![Commandments](https://i0.wp.com/stillromancatholicafteralltheseyears.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/MOSES-TEN-COMMANDMENTS.jpg?ssl=1)

## We will focus on declarative sentences

## Is a commandment true or false? {.center}

## The Most Famous Reindeer of All

1. If the fetus is a person, then abortion is murder.

2. The fetus is a person.

$\therefore$

3. Abortion is murder.

---

### Sentence Letters {.center}

**P**

**Q**

Sometimes **S**, or even **R**.

## Remember?

Replace the claims with sentence letters and ignore the connectives for now.

* Look only for true or false statements.

1. If the fetus is a person, then abortion is murder.

2. The fetus is a person.

$\therefore$

3. Abortion is murder.

---

For now, lets leave the connetives there, but replace the propositions with sentence letters.

1. If, P, then Q.

2. P.

$\therefore$

3. Q.

---

1. IF it is not true that all swans are white,

2. AND the president believes that all swans are white,

3. THEN the president is fallible

---

1. IF it is not true that all swans are white,

2. AND the president believes that all swans are white,

3. THEN the president is fallible

---

1. If, **P** *and* **Q**

2. then, **R**

---

1. If Clara won't get the raise, then she'll quit.

2. She won't get the raise.

$\thefore$

3. She'll quit.

---

1. If she quits, Clara won't get the raise.

2. She won't get the raise.

$\therefore$

3. She'll quit.

## Falacious Argument Forms

* Modus Ponens

* Affirming the Consequent

## Let's identify the main components of this argument.

> So, then, no one who understands what God is can conceive that God does not exist; although he says these words in his heart, either without any, or with some, foreign signification. For; God is that than which a greater cannot be conceived. And he who thoroughly understands this assuredly understands that this being so truly exists, that not even in concept can it be nonexistent. Therefore, he who understands that God so exists cannot conceive that he does not exist.

---

### We are going to be looking for:

* ***Propositions*** (Sentences/tf Statements)

* ***Logical Operators*** (Connect Propositions)

* ***Scope*** (Which logical operators apply to which propositions)

---

What might we do next?

* What should we identify first?

<p class="fragment fade-in-then-out">So, then, no one who understands what God is can conceive that God does not exist; although he says these words in his heart, either without any, or with some, foreign signification.
